1j9zdif,"Trump: New travel barriers for Canadian tourists, the biggest source of US tourism. Expect impact on airlines, hotels, retail, restaurants",6490,852,Mountain-Taro-123,2025-03-12 20:28:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9zdif/trump_new_travel_barriers_for_canadian_tourists/,0.96,False,False,False,"Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?

* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists** travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly **contributed $6.5b** to Florida's economy **during just a 6 month period** (typical duration of their stays)
* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US** comprising of **\~30% of all US tourist visits** in 2023.
* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money
* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.
* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies

I'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries

* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.
* **Travel Bookers**: Expedia? Not sure how much of their revenue concentration is based on US bookings vs. global
* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment
* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,
* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)
* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts
* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis
* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)
* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted

Other factors to consider before making moves

* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?
* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?
* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?

Edit: In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries. Vive la Canada!

1j9mlkx,Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Elon Musk’s politics are having ‘negative’ or ‘extremely negative’ impact on company,5601,185,Puginator,2025-03-12 11:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j9mlkx/tesla_investor_survey_shows_85_believe_elon_musks/,0.97,False,False,False,"More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

1jbv5dh,The Mar-A-Lago Accord - they are crashing the market AND the dollar,2787,151,big-papito,2025-03-15 09:30:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jbv5dh/the_maralago_accord_they_are_crashing_the_market/,0.91,False,False,False,"So I've posted around this paper by Stephen Miran, ringing the alarm bells regarding what they are trying to do: [https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199\_A\_Users\_Guide\_to\_Restructuring\_the\_Global\_Trading\_System.pdf](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf)

He is Trump's new chief economic adviser. Guess what? The word ""tariff"" appears here 215 times. This is the plan. This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - ""pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.""

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord. It's not a name of some conspiracy theory. This policy paper mentions ""Mar-A-Lago Accord"" as a thing: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html)

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Dionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:

1jalltg,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,2211,416,Shalaiyn,2025-03-13 16:17:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jalltg/stocks_tumble_into_correction_as_investors_sour/,0.93,False,False,False,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.
