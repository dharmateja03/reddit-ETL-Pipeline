Tesla’s stock price continues to show volatility in early March trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. This follows Monday’s steep 15.4% drop that marked the company’s worst trading day in nearly five years.

The electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on Wednesday and 3.8% on Tuesday. These gains came after President Donald Trump’s public commitment to purchase a Tesla Model S during a White House event with CEO Elon Musk.

Despite the recent uptick, Tesla stock remains down almost 50% from its mid-December record high. The current price hovers around $245.75 in premarket trading.",stocks,2025-03-20 09:04:31.782679,822,False

1jbv5dh,The Mar-A-Lago Accord - they are crashing the market AND the dollar,2850,148,big-papito,2025-03-15 09:30:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jbv5dh/the_maralago_accord_they_are_crashing_the_market/,0.91,False,False,False,"So I've posted around this paper by Stephen Miran, ringing the alarm bells regarding what they are trying to do: [https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199\_A\_Users\_Guide\_to\_Restructuring\_the\_Global\_Trading\_System.pdf](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf)

He is Trump's new chief economic adviser. Guess what? The word ""tariff"" appears here 215 times. This is the plan. This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - ""pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.""

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord. It's not a name of some conspiracy theory. This policy paper mentions ""Mar-A-Lago Accord"" as a thing: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html)

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Dionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:

1jalltg,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,2217,414,Shalaiyn,2025-03-13 16:17:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jalltg/stocks_tumble_into_correction_as_investors_sour/,0.93,False,False,False,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

They're official stock certificates from the 80s, previous owners long gone (I think there have been three or four homeowners between then and now).

Are they worth anything? Who do I take them to if they are?

EDIT 2: I got into contact with the original owner’s daughter, who is now in her 70s and had no idea it existed. Her mother, the original owner of the stock certificate, worked for Boeing for many years and was the first female flight supervisor in their area. I will be giving them the certificate this evening. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t at least try to get these documents back to their rightful owners. 

EDIT 3: The original owner’s grandson came and picked up the certificate as well as two more boxes of old letters and documents from his late grandmother. We had a great conversation and they want to invite us over soon for dinner after they go through everything and reminisce. I feel very good about the outcome of the situation.
