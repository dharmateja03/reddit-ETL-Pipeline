#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

# The Facts

* Longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber on Wednesday publicly called for Elon Musk to step down as Chief Executive Officer, citing Musk's divided attention between Tesla and his role in the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a special adviser in the Trump administration.
* In an interview, Gerber said Tesla is ""absolutely"" in crisis and has been ""neglected for too long."" He added, ""It's time for somebody to run Tesla.""
* Tesla's market value has decreased by more than $800B since December, with shares down over 50% from their peak. The electric vehicle maker is facing declining sales and increasing competition in key markets.
* In addition, the company is experiencing a nationwide boycott in reaction to Musk's actions with the administration. There have been incidents of vandalism at showrooms and charging stations, including Molotov cocktail attacks in Las Vegas and gunshots fired at facilities in Portland.
* Previously, Gerber's wealth management firm, which owned 262,352 Tesla shares as of February, began selling shares in 2023 as concerns mounted over Musk's leadership and Tesla's declining reputation.
* Multiple Tesla executives have sold over $100M worth of shares since early February, including James Murdoch's $13M sale and Kimbal Musk's — Elon Musk's brother — disposal of 75K shares worth approximately $27M.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,1521,False

The stainless steel strip, called a cant rail assembly, between the windshield and the roof on both sides, is bound to the truck’s assembly with a structural adhesive, the NHTSA report said. The remedy uses an adhesive that’s not been found to be vulnerable to “environmental embrittlement,” the NHTSA said, and includes additional reinforcements.""

1ji0n3r,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia — The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism",2374,176,30030s,2025-03-23 10:35:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ji0n3r/tariffs_doge_and_columbia_the_market_will_crash/,0.87,False,False,False,"There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. 

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. 

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. 

TSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. 

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck. 

Trumpism is government regulation on steroids.   ",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,3724,False

Together, four top officers at the company have offloaded over $100 million in shares since early February.

Last week, longtime Musk ally James Murdoch -- the estranged son of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch and a board member since 2017 -- became the latest to do so, exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately $13 million, according to an SEC filing. The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.

According to one filing, the shares were sold ""to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.""

Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.

The chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.

A number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.

""Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,"" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.

However, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.

""Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,"" Ritter said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.

""While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,"" Goldstein said.

The share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.

ABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.

Tesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.

> White House aides are preparing to impose new tariffs on most imports on April 2, laying the groundwork for an escalation in global economic hostilities that President Donald Trump has called “Liberation Day.”
> 
> Through his first two months in office, the president has raised tariffs on roughly $800 billion in imports from China, Mexico and Canada, although estimates vary widely. These tariffs have sent the stock market careening and raised the risks of a U.S. recession, while inviting retaliation against domestic industries by trade partners.
> 
> Despite the blowback, senior Trump advisers are now publicly pledging to create a new tariff regime that would impose new duties on trade with most countries that trade with the United States. A person familiar with internal planning, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations, confirmed administration officials are preparing tariffs on “trillions” of dollars in imports.
> 
> The potential to more than double the scope of Trump’s tariffs has alarmed economists and some congressional Republicans, while other White House allies are concerned about the logistical challenges of a complicated new import tax regime. The precise nature of these new duties has spurred extensive discussions at the highest levels of the administration, with Vice President JD Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House aide Peter Navarro and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent all playing a role in the talks, the person familiar with the plans said.
> 
> ""The last two months have already hurt American businesses and consumers, but the April 2 deadline seriously could make all of that look like a tempest in a teapot,” said Joseph Politano, an economic policy analyst at Apricitas Economics. “We don’t know exactly what they’re going to do, but from what they’re saying, it sounds functionally like new tariffs on all U.S. imports.”
> 
> The internal preparations suggest Trump remains unbowed in his push to upend the global trade order, despite deepening unease among allies on Capitol Hill and Wall Street and outright fury from overseas. Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to encourage companies to move production back to the U.S. and force concessions from foreign trading partners, but the fallout has rattled investors and consumers, leading to declines in several key economic indicators.
> 
> “It’s a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries, including friend and foe,” Trump told reporters on Monday.
> 
> Trump has dubbed the next stage of his trade war “reciprocal tariffs.” The president first embraced the idea during his 2024 presidential campaign, arguing that other countries impose far higher trade barriers on U.S. exports than the U.S. government charges on imports. Trump has said the U.S. should match these tariffs with “reciprocal” duties that he believes will force other countries to lower their duties on U.S.-made products.

1jir9a5,Bayer hit with $2 billion Roundup verdict in US state of Georgia cancer case,1310,143,WinningWatchlist,2025-03-24 09:57:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jir9a5/bayer_hit_with_2_billion_roundup_verdict_in_us/,0.98,False,False,False,"Bayer was ordered by a jury in the U.S. state of Georgia to pay about $2.1 billion to a plaintiff who claimed the company's Roundup weed killer caused his cancer, the plaintiff's law firms said late on Friday.

The verdict, which Bayer said on Saturday it would appeal, is one of the largest legal settlements issued in a Roundup-related case and is the latest setback for the group, among the world's largest seeds and pesticides makers.

Bayer has paid about $10 billion to settle disputed claims that Roundup, based on the herbicide glyphosate, causes cancer. Over 60,000 further cases are pending for which the group has set aside $5.9 billion in legal provisions.

The German pharmaceutical and biotechnology group acquired Roundup as part of its $63 billion takeover of U.S. agrochemical company Monsanto in 2018.

The Georgia verdict includes $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, according to a statement emailed to Reuters by the plaintiff's law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC.

Bayer said in a statement it disagreed with the jury’s verdict, as it conflicted with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.

""We believe that we have strong arguments on appeal to get this verdict overturned and the excessive and unconstitutional damage awards eliminated or reduced,"" it said.

It said that damages in cases that have reached final judgements have been reduced 90% overall compared with the original jury awards.

Earlier this month, Bayer told U.S. lawmakers it could stop selling Roundup unless they strengthened legal protection against product liability litigation, a financial analyst and person close to the matter told Reuters.

Beat earnings with EPS of .54. Saw revenue declines across brands but CEO said this was expected as they disrupted the sales cycle by pulling back inventory to reset company focus and product. Effective tax rate around 5% due to a currency write off for Q4. 

FY revenue for last time NIKE traded consistently in this range was 36.4b in 2018

FY revenue for 2024 was 51.36b. 

Nike took charges for reductions in workforce and discounting to clear out old unsold inventory this quarter and will continue to reduce inventory pulling inventory from resellers in 26’ to make room for fresh product.

Share float in 2018 was 1.6b and share float today is around 1.48b showing a reduction in share float via repurchases. 

Turnaround expected around 27’ if execution by company is successful. 26’ will be focused on clearing stock, creating brand stories, and building new inventory to bring resellers which are re establishing relationships with Nike to put product back on shelves. 

CEO said focus is on the athlete first and gender needs second. 

Nike is a behemoth compared to Hoka, ASIC and other brands which seems to get paraded in discussion here. Nike could probably buy either company if they wanted to. The scale of the company is where I see value. 

I’m buying and holding at this point, but would love other thoughts. 


My opinion is an unpopular one but I think the government backs off from tariffs sooner than people expect. I could be wrong.

1jgj4af,Tesla’s Retail Fans Buy the Stock at a Pace Never Seen Before,943,501,cefpodoxime,2025-03-21 11:12:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jgj4af/teslas_retail_fans_buy_the_stock_at_a_pace_never/,0.84,False,False,False,"Tesla Inc.’s stock is in a freefall. Its sales are plunging around the world. Even its most avid Wall Street bulls are turning cautious. But one group is buying the electric-vehicle maker’s shares like never before: CEO Elon Musk’s fans.
The company has always had a strong fan-base among individual investors, who hang on Musk’s every word on X, the social-media platform he owns. They analyze Tesla in great detail in online forums, and largely function as a hype crew for the stock.
But their current level of enthusiasm is staggeringly high, even by recent historical standards. Individual investors have been net buyers of Tesla shares for 13 straight sessions through Thursday, pumping $8 billion into the stock, retail trading data from JPMorgan Chase’s global equity derivatives strategist Emma Wu shows. That’s the biggest inflow over any buying streak since 2015, which is as far back as the data goes.

What makes the buying notable is Tesla’s share price has sunk 17% over this time, wiping out more than $155 billion from its market value.
“Tesla made some rookie to mid-stage public market investors extremely wealthy, a lot of people became millionaires because of this stock,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “People don’t forget that. And they will come back to a stock again and again if they feel it has been beaten up.”
Tesla shares have been on a steep slide since mid-December when it touched an all-time high fueled by optimism from Donald Trump’s election victory. But that euphoria vanished, with the stock retreating more than 50% from its Dec. 17 record, making it the second biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year. The rout has been so brutal that on Thursday Musk sought to reassure Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting, telling them to “hang on to your stock.”

What’s become clear is what Wall Street thought was a bonus for the company, Musk’s prominent role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has become an albatross. His growing political presence and involvement with controversies in Europe have triggered a backlash against the company and its leader, with the cars increasingly seen as political symbols. Protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla showrooms, and vandalized charging stations.

The impact is showing up in the company’s financials. Sales of the Tesla’s cars have sunk in key European markets, such as France and Germany, as well as in China and Australia. The US numbers won’t be available until the company reports its first-quarter delivery figures early next month, but analysts across Wall Street have been aggressively cutting their estimates for sales and profits, citing the bleak data from around the globe.

On Thursday, long-time Tesla bull and Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered his price target on the stock and reduced his sales expectations for the company citing growing competition, an aging vehicle lineup and a “buyers’ strike from negative brand sentiment.” However, he kept his buy-equivalent rating on the shares, saying the weak near-term expectations are “not particularly narrative changing” for a company whose future depends on robotics and artificial intelligence.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives on Friday lauded Musk’s efforts for “hand holding” employees and investors at a key time, and said that if the CEO continued to lead on his vision the stock will be on a growth path where 90% of its valuation will be led by autonomous driving technology and robotics. This bullishness explains at least some of retail traders’ continuing enthusiasm for the shares.
“These kind of investors don’t care about valuations at all,” Colas said. “They just believe in the future of the company and Elon Musk’s abilities.”

1jheaxd,Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash,849,362,Rainyfriedtofu,2025-03-22 13:53:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/,0.83,False,False,False,"Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately—don’t take it too seriously),

I’ve been seeing a flood of posts about Tesla lately, and I’ll admit—I’m feeling the FOMO. But instead of just jumping in impulsively, I wanted to take a step back and explore the broader implications of what’s happening with Tesla and the U.S. market as a whole.

Now, I’m not claiming to have all the answers. In fact, I know that no one person can fully grasp the entire landscape—there are just too many moving parts. That’s exactly why we’re here: to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and grow smarter together. If you think I’ve got something wrong, by all means, correct me—I welcome it.

With that said, I’ll get straight to the point: like many of you, I believe Tesla’s current stock price is inflated beyond what makes sense for a car company. That’s not up for debate in my view. The real question is when it’s going to come back down to earth.

I think some of the hardcore short sellers may have shown up too early to the party. Yes, they’re making noise and causing some damage, but it’s still early days. The key reason? Elon and Trump still have enough firepower—both financial and cultural—to prop this thing up, at least for the short term. Between their loyal fanbases and their connections to wealthy, influential backers, they’re capable of swinging retail sentiment when needed.

From a technical perspective, we also appear to be entering the Last Point of Supply (LPSY) phase in Wyckoff distribution. That’s the stage where the stock experiences one final upward thrust before demand dries up and the markdown phase begins. We won’t be able to confirm this until after the fact, but this setup suggests there may still be one last upswing before reality sets in.

And let’s not forget how easily Elon and Trump can manufacture short-term narratives to keep the hype train rolling. For example:

1. Elon announces a new, cheaper model with an overly optimistic delivery timeline.

2. Trump announces plans to transition the federal vehicle fleet to Teslas.

3. A surprise decision is made to standardize all federal charging stations to Tesla’s NAC.

4. Suddenly, a new mandate appears—every automaker must adopt the NAC standard “by tomorrow.”

5, Tesla remains the only EV maker eligible for tax credits, while competitors lose out.

All hypothetical, of course—but not far-fetched. These kinds of announcements, even if temporary or empty promises, are more than enough to juice the stock price and keep hope alive a little longer.

But here’s the thing: this won’t work in the long run. The brand itself is becoming radioactive. Tesla is quickly approaching the kind of cultural toxicity we associate with names like “Adolf” or the toothbrush mustache. No matter how much mental gymnastics some bagholders perform, you can’t deny the rot underneath. The company has shown no real innovation, has no competitive moat, and has been delivering nothing but negative headlines for months.

1. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant decline of nearly 50% in three months, reducing its market capitalization from an all-time high of $1.5 trillion to $845 billion.

4. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, urged employees to hold onto their stock amidst a significant surge in vehicle trade-ins and dealership vandalism.

9. In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060)  If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.

Going back to the whole CEO encourage people to not sell their stock, we have many examples in history that tell us this is an ""Oh Shit"" moment.

In September 2001, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay urged employees to buy more Enron shares, reassuring them that the company's upcoming quarterly financial report was ""looking great."" He stated, ""The company is fundamentally sound. At current stock prices... this seems to be an incredibly cheap stock."" Shortly after Lay's assurances, Enron disclosed massive financial losses and accounting irregularities, leading to a rapid decline in stock value. The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, marking one of the most infamous corporate collapses in history. [https://www.recordnet.com/story/news/2002/01/19/ceo-urged-buying-stock/50764571007/](https://www.recordnet.com/story/news/2002/01/19/ceo-urged-buying-stock/50764571007/)

In the months leading up to Lehman Brothers' collapse, CEO Richard Fuld and other top executives publicly expressed confidence in the firm's financial stability. Despite these assurances, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, marking one of the largest failures in financial history and a pivotal event in the global financial crisis.

In March 2008, Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz publicly stated that the firm was not facing a liquidity crisis, aiming to reassure investors and employees about the company's stability. Days after these statements, Bear Stearns faced a severe liquidity crunch, leading to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase at a significantly reduced stock price, highlighting the rapid deterioration of its financial position. We're not there yet, but JPMorgan pt is $120.

Angelo Mozilo, CEO of Countrywide Financial, consistently expressed optimism about the company's prospects amid rising concerns about the subprime mortgage market. Despite Mozilo's positive outlook, Countrywide suffered massive losses due to its exposure to subprime mortgages, leading to its acquisition by Bank of America in 2008 as the financial crisis unfolded.

I’ve lived through enough so-called “once-in-a-lifetime” financial events to know when the market is out of whack—and we are definitely in one of those moments.

Before we zoom out to talk about the broader economy, I want to challenge you to look around your own community. Talk to small business owners. Ask how their foot traffic and revenue are doing. Most will tell you business is down. People simply have less money and are spending less.

You can even see the signs in the everyday stuff:

\- Less traffic on the roads.

\- Empty parking lots where there used to be crowds.

\- Local shops offering more discounts, desperate to get people through the door.

These are the subtle, everyday indicators that the economy is softening—not just in isolated pockets, but everywhere from California to Maine.

And it’s not just consumers—farmers are on the brink. Operating costs are soaring, demand is shrinking, and programs that used to keep them afloat—like USAID—are being cut. Add to that tariffs on our allies, and we’re creating a ripple effect that could drag the entire global economy down with us.

The signs on the macro level are many at the moment. For example, Consumers make up about 70% of U.S. GDP, so when people stop spending, the economy slows down. Lower retail sales, slower restaurant traffic, fewer car purchases, and decreased discretionary spending are all down. Next week. we have durable goods orders, GDP growth rate QoQ, core PCE price index, personal income, and personal spending. 

By definition, a recession is often (though not officially) defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. We won't see this for a while, but by the time we see this, there is no point in me writing this post because I will just be captain obvious. However, the thing we should look for, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and Industrial Production reports often show early weakness. A reading below 50 in the PMI signals contraction in the manufacturing sector — a major red flag. As of February 2025, the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.3, indicating a slight expansion in the manufacturing sector. This reflects a marginal decrease from January's PMI of 50.9.

Looking at unemployment rate, when companies expect slower growth, they lay off workers. If we see an increase in unemployment rate and initial jobless claims, it would fit our thesis that our economy is getting ready to eat shit, and no amount of bullshit will save luxury goods like Tesla from the crash. As of February 2025, the U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, a slight increase from 4.0% in January.

Another key indicator to watch is the yield curve, particularly when it becomes inverted — a condition that has contributed to the strange and unpredictable market behavior we've seen over the past couple of weeks. A yield curve inversion occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, most commonly measured by comparing the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Under normal conditions, long-term bonds yield more than short-term ones because of the risks associated with time. But when investors grow pessimistic about the economic outlook, they start buying more long-term bonds (driving those yields down), while short-term rates remain elevated — often due to central bank policy. This reversal in the yield curve is widely interpreted as the bond market signaling a potential economic downturn. Historically, the 2-year/10-year inversion has been one of the most reliable predictors of recessions in the U.S., accurately signaling nearly every major economic downturn since World War II. While I’m not an expert in the mechanics behind this, I’ve been noticing that the recent yield curve dynamics are likely playing a role in the market volatility and erratic swings we've been witnessing. These sharp ups and downs aren’t happening in a vacuum — they're part of a broader pattern of uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment rooted in concerns about future economic health.

Then we have the earnings. When companies begin missing revenue and earnings targets, it can reflect a slowdown in sales and consumer demand. The next few months will be the make-it-or-break-it for the economy. So far, many larger company has been missing their revenue and earning targets--looking at you walmart and target. 

Anyway, that’s just my two cents. A lot of people have been saying that the market is acting irrationally — that the recent swings and volatility don't make sense. But from where I stand, especially when considering the actions of market manipulators and the broader economic indicators, the market actually appears very rational — just not in the way most people expect.

What we’re seeing isn’t chaos without cause; it’s a market reacting to carefully orchestrated narratives, short-term hype, and policy signals. Of course, I also believe that the government and major institutions are doing what they can to project confidence and calm public sentiment, likely to prevent panic selling and maintain a sense of stability. That doesn’t necessarily mean things are fine — it just means they're trying to delay the consequences.

For those of us paying attention, now is the time to really reflect. This moment calls for managing our risks, thinking critically, and planning how we want to move forward in an economy that feels increasingly uncertain. Whether that means reallocating investments, building cash reserves, or reassessing personal and business goals, it’s important we stay proactive rather than reactive.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,15803,False
1jg4o6x,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,768,80,callsonreddit,2025-03-20 20:51:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jg4o6x/exclusivetesla_tradeins_on_pace_for_record_high/,0.93,False,False,False,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

1jfz1fw,Accenture is DOGE’s first corporate casualty as shares dive on warning that contracts will be cut,735,79,Puginator,2025-03-20 16:40:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfz1fw/accenture_is_doges_first_corporate_casualty_as/,0.97,False,False,False,"Shares of Accenture slid Thursday after the consulting firm said efforts to tighten federal spending have begun to weigh on its revenues.

Shares tumbled 7.3% after Accenture’s chief executive officer said in a fiscal second-quarter earnings call that the company’s Federal Services business has lost contracts with the U.S. government after recent reviews.

“Federal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our Americas revenue in FY 2024. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue,” chief executive Julie Spellman Sweet said in the Thursday call to several Wall Street analysts.

Accenture is among the first of the U.S. corporate giants to get hit by the Trump administration’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, an effort headed by billionaire Elon Musk to downsize federal agencies and consolidate their office spaces.

Sweet said that Accenture’s Federal Services was also affected by guidance from the U.S. General Services Administration to all federal agencies to review their contracts with the top 10 highest paid consulting firms contracting with the U.S. government, and then end contracts that are not considered mission-critical to relevant agencies.

“While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission-critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government’s priorities evolve and these assessments unfold,” Sweet said.

“We are seeing an elevated level of what was already a significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our first quarter FY 2025 earnings report in December,” Sweet added. “At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong.”

Investors’ concerns about risks tied to slowing U.S. government spending outweighed Accenture’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue results released before Thursday’s market open. The company reported earnings of $2.82 per share on revenue of $16.66 billion, just higher than expectations of $2.81 per share in earnings on revenue of $16.62 billion, per FactSet.

Accenture shares have plunged 22.9% over the past month, bringing the stock down nearly 14.5% year to date.

Shares of consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton slipped 8.1% on Thursday in sympathy.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

I never imagined that something I’d write would get this kind of traction. But some of the comments in that thread raised important questions and valid counterpoints—so I wanted to follow up with a deeper response.

Now, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures—just a heads-up: this sub doesn’t support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you’ll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it’s worth your time.

Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you’re someone who can’t—or won’t—read through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn’t for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you’re setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let’s dive in.

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)

Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)

Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*—they're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn’t meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard—like Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla—it doesn’t cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.

As for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up—so Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.

Remember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? ""In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.""

If this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.

With that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue—which includes income from vehicle sales and related services—totaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.

You might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I’ve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out—including four of their vehicles.

Tesla’s sky-high valuation wasn’t just hype—it was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.

It wasn’t just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.

Elon Musk wasn’t just building a car company—he was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:

* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles
* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)
* Insurance and financing
* And the “gas stations” of the future—their Supercharger network

It was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.

Had Tesla stayed on that course—doubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance—they truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.

I was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.

What truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company’s decision to step back from its charging station expansion—the very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.

In late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn’t a small reorganization—it was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla’s vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)

In response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network—but at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.

[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)

For Tesla’s automotive partners—like Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla’s NACS charging standard—this sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)

As a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I’ve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers—something that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be—sometimes even half as fast.

On top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home—because it’s five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!

**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the “gas stations” of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**

But that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem—end to end—has fractured. And it’s hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.

u/Qc4281 ""I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.""

It’s time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).

Waymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn’t a prototype—it’s real, operational, and public.

Their Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car—no safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.

In contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.

Waymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:

* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping
* Radar for object detection in poor visibility
* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts

Tesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it’s also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.

Elon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy “next year” since 2016—nearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such

Tesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input—but even that milestone has not been reached. It’s based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon’s ambitious promises get attention—but when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.

Now we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla’s Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments—construction sites, factories, even police and research teams.

Tesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages—Tesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it’s not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it’s still being tested internally and isn’t commercially deployed.

Boston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.

I think I’ve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that “Tesla is more than just a car company.” The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision—revolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.

But that vision has faded.

Today, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk’s shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that’s trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space—fields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.

The ambition is still there—but the execution no longer matches the hype.

Now, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‘Test’ serves the same but opposite function as the ‘Spring’ in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn’t change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.

[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)

The LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it’s often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag—buying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the “smart money” has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.

In Tesla’s case, these signs are already becoming visible. We’re seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered “good news.” At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in—delays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla’s recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.

One thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I’m praying that I’m wrong. I don’t *want* the economy to crash. But I’ve lived through a recession before—and I remember it vividly.

Back in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings—and in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.

Right now, I believe we're entering a recession—or at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I’m sharing this because I hope you’ll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market—which had peaked in October 2007—began to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.

By mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That’s 3.5 years of waiting—and that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.

I still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act—ignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don’t place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.

Looking ahead, the week of March 24–30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we’ll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month’s +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that’s significant—because durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don’t tell the full story—it needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.

On Thursday, we’ll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially “ring the recession bell” just yet—but June’s data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into ""oh-shit"" mode.

Then on Friday, we’ll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that’s another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows—simple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.

For the week of March 31–April 6, we’ll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven’t been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint—especially in combination with all the metrics above—we’ll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I’m laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.

You may think I’m being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly—I hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I’m wrong?

Looking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was “fundamentally sound,” even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged “economic challenges” but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.

This isn’t about being Republican or Democrat. It’s about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don’t—we need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can’t afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.

Let’s circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand—because that’s an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector—cars, fashion, jewelry, travel—was no exception.

If you haven’t already, take a look at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself—what about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally “luxury,” thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It’s also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences—another luxury-like behavior.

Then there’s the VIX, the so-called “fear index” that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you’ll notice that it’s starting to resemble the early stages of 2008—with rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.

Some may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously—the pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.

This time is different. What we’re seeing now is primarily an American problem—rooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.

So when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs—from LVMH to ABNB to the VIX—are stacking up. This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s pattern recognition.

Lastly—and I want to emphasize this—I'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.

However, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window—whether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation—will be the “tell” that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.

You don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there’s so much unfolding right now that it’s hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they’ve already lost so much.

Just remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn’t about timing the top or the bottom—it’s about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.

As always, I welcome your thoughts, counterpoints, or insights. Let’s navigate this together.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,27717,False

> 
> At the top of Berlin’s shopping list are six F127 battleships from Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems valued at more than €15 billion ($16.4 billion), and 20 added Eurofighter jets from BAE and its partners worth some €3 billion, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the procurement plans aren’t public.
> 
> The emphasis on European-made gear marks a departure from Germany’s previous €100 billion splurge in 2022. A strong “Buy American” component in that debt-financed deal, orchestrated by outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, led to orders for 35 F-35 fighter jets, 60 Chinook transport helicopters made by Boeing Co. and Patriot air-defense systems.
> 
> German lawmakers this week are expected to pass sweeping changes to the constitution that will remove borrowing restriction for defense spending in excess of 1% of gross domestic product, or roughly €45 billion ($49 billion). As most of the €100 billion from the special fund to modernize the Bundeswehr armed forces is either spent or earmarked, the new legislation will open the flood gates for additional defense procurement projects of unprecedented scale.
> 
> European defense-focused stocks have been among the biggest gainers this year as governments make a more concerted push to increase their military budgets and seek to procure more from their home region. US arms shipments still make up the majority of exports to NATO countries, meaning Europe has to catch up if it wants to gain a bigger share of the investments.

> The Thyssenkrupp unit formed a joint venture last year with domestic shipbuilder Naval Vessels Lürssen to pitch for the F127 order. The deal, which could even surpass the targeted price tag of €15 billion, is likely to be passed by budget lawmakers in the second half of this year, the people added.
> 
> A defense ministry spokesman declined to comment.

> Another big order will be the purchase of 20 added Eurofighter jets in a contract worth up to €3 billion, the people said. The Eurofighter is made by a partnership led by Britain’s BAE, Franco-German aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE and Italy’s Leonardo SpA.
> 
> Scholz announced the intention for the purchase in a speech at the Berlin air show in June 2024, but the order so far was not executed due to disagreements over spending priorities in the outgoing coalition.
> 
> **Shifting Priorities**
> 
> Some lawmakers had argued that Germany shouldn’t invest too much in fighter jets, after the €10 billion purchase of the 35 Lockheed Martin Corp. F35s in 2022 ate up roughly one 10th of the first special fund.
> 
> With budget constraints soon to be lifted, Berlin will now push ahead with the Eurofighter order to balance out its military procurement and put a bigger emphasis on European manufacturers, the people said. In 2020, Germany placed an order for 38 Eurofighter jets worth €5.5 billion.
> 
> Germany also plans to invest several billion euros into the modernization of its military satellite infrastructure, the people said. One beneficiary could be OHB SE, the Bremen-based manufacturer that won a €2.1 billion German order last year.
> 
> Other spending targets include hundred of millions of euros for artillery ammunition, according to the people, including by exercising options on existing contracts with Germany’s Rheinmetall AG and others. Germany also plans more investments in air defense, after large parts of the first fund were spent to buy Iris-T systems from Bavaria-based Diehl, Patriot systems from the US and Arrow 3 from Israel and the US, the people added.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Who the heck is giving these insane price targets? I have never seen such high valuations on a company in decline, with sales deteriorating as we speak!

Are these analysts politically motivated to prop up Tesla stock because they’re scared Elon Musk will ruin their firms, since he’s in the government now? That’s pretty selfish thinking in my opinion, and isn’t this kind of blatantly false analyst ratings considered market manipulation?


This is why I don’t follow analyst ratings on any stocks to make my financial decisions. In February, Tesla's sales slumped in the U.S., Australia, China, and several European countries. The fall was precipitous in some markets, including Germany, where sales collapsed by 76% last month, and Italy, where Tesla registered a 55% drop.

You’ve got Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, literally shilling Tesla stock on Fox News. Isn’t that illegal?

Tesla's stock price has sunk roughly 41% this year, although it remains up 46% over the last 12 months after surging in the weeks following Trump's electoral victory in November.

Just wondering how many of you agree that this goes against the philosophy of staying the course and think this is stupid?  Besides the fact that selling can have a tax implication if you’re in a brokerage, in my brain, this is timing the market.

If everybody thinks something is going to happen, does that not mean the thing is in someways also priced in?   No doubt in my mind that the stupid shit that Trump is doing is going to cause more dips and a lot more red days.

But people pulling their investments out into cash right now are panic selling in my mind.  The only thing that happens when people panic cell is the wealthy buy those stocks at a discount.

If I was sitting on individual stocks then yeah I’d be a lot worried.  But I’m very broadly diversified.  I actually threw a chunk in last week and am scruffy buying the dip.

The amount of people screaming “it’s different this time” and the number of top comments being like “glad I sold everything and go out when I did” are really shocking. I think this is what is talked about when people say the words “panic selling”.  The fact that so many people are saying this in the market is being driven by extreme fear makes me feel like there may be a degree of mass hysteria happening.

1jf3fbr,"Fed holds interest rates steady, still sees two cuts coming this year",355,74,_hiddenscout,2025-03-19 14:05:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jf3fbr/fed_holds_interest_rates_steady_still_sees_two/,0.97,False,False,False,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fed-rate-decision-march-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fed-rate-decision-march-2025.html)

The Federal Reserve in a closely watched decision Wednesday held the line on benchmark interest rates though still indicated that reductions are likely later in the year.  
  
Faced with pressing concerns over the impact tariffs will have on a slowing economy, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee kept its key borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December. Markets had been pricing in virtually zero chance of a move at this week’s two-day policy meeting.  
  
Along with the decision, officials updated their rate and economic projections for this year and through 2027 and altered the pace at which they are reducing bond holdings.  
  
Despite the uncertain impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs as well as an ambitious fiscal policy of tax breaks and deregulation, officials said they still see another half percentage point of rate cuts through 2025. The Fed prefers to move in quarter percentage point increments, so that would mean two cuts this year.  
  
In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC noted an elevated level of ambiguity surrounding the current climate.  
  
“Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,” the document stated. “The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.“  
  
The Fed is charged with the twin-goals of maintaining full employment and low prices.  
  
The committee downgraded its collective outlook for economic growth and gave a bump higher to its inflation projection. Officials now see the economy accelerating at just a 1.7% pace this year, down 0.4 percentage point from the last projection in December. On inflation, core prices are expected to grow at a 2.8% annual pace, up 0.3 percentage point from the previous estimate.  
  
According to the “dot plot” of officials’ rate expectations, the view is turning somewhat more hawkish on rates from December. At the previous meeting, just one participant saw no rate changes in 2025, compared to four now.  
  
The grid showed rate expectations unchanged over December for future years, with the equivalent of two cuts expected in 2026 and one more in 2027 before the fed funds rate settles in at a longer-run level around 3%.  
  
In addition to the rate decision, the Fed announced a further scaling back of its “quantitative tightening” program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet.  
  
The central bank now will allow just $5 billion in maturing proceeds from Treasurys to roll off each month, down from $25 billion. However, it left a $35 billion cap on mortgage-backed securities unchanged, a level it has rarely hit since starting the process.  
  
Fed Governor Christopher Waller was the lone dissenting vote for the Fed’s move. However, the statement noted that Waller favored holding rates steady but wanted to see the QT program go on as before.  
  
The Fed’s actions follow a hectic beginning to President Donald Trump’s second term in office. The Republican has rattled financial markets with tariffs implemented thus far on steel, aluminum and an assortment of other goods against U.S. global trading partners.  
  
In addition, the administration is threatening another round of even more aggressive duties following a review that is scheduled for release April 2.  
  
An uncertain air over what is to come has dimmed the confidence of consumers, who in recent surveys have jacked up inflation expectations because of the tariffs. Retail spending increased in February, albeit less than expected though underlying indicators showed that consumers are still weathering the stormy political climate.  
  
Stocks have been fragile since Trump assumed office, with major averages dipping in and out of correction territory as administration officials cautioned about an economic reset away from government-fueled stimulus and towards a more private sector-oriented approach.  
  
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan earlier Wednesday countered much of the gloomy talk recently around Wall Street. The head of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets said card data shows spending is continuing at a solid pace, with BofA’s economists expecting the economy to grow around 2% this year.  
  
However, some cracks have been showing in the labor market.  
  
Nonfarm payrolls grew at a slower than expected pace in February and a broad measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underemployed workers jumped a half percentage point during the month to its highest level since October 2021.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,4668,False

1je6elq,Google to acquire cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion,260,71,Puginator,2025-03-18 10:35:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1je6elq/google_to_acquire_cloud_security_startup_wiz_for/,0.94,False,False,False,"Google on Tuesday signed a “definitive agreement” to acquire Wiz, the New York-based cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash deal, according to releases.

The deal, which will be Google’s largest-ever acquisition, will improve its cloud security offering in a world of advancing artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats. Wiz will become a part of the company’s cloud business. Google said it expects to close the deal in 2026.

“Google Cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure, with deep AI expertise and a track record of industry-leading security innovation,” Google said in a release. “Bringing all this to Wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable, benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds.”

The acquisition comes after CNBC reported in July that Wiz had walked away from a potential $23 billion acquisition by Google and announced to employees that it would pursue an initial public offering instead.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport wrote to employees in a July memo obtained by CNBC. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that Wiz walked away from the deal in part due to antitrust and investor concerns.

Before talks with Google were reported, Wiz had set its sights on two goals: an IPO and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. In the memo at the time, Rappaport wrote that the company would pursue those milestones.

Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under Rappaport, with the company hitting $100 million in annual recurring revenue after just 18 months. The company’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that’s appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft, which also sells security software.

“Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,” Rappaport said in a blog post Tuesday.

Google has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers. Its largest deal before Wiz was the $12.5 billion acquisition of hardware marker Motorola in 2012. Two years later, the company sold some assets to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past, paying $5.4 billion for Mandiant in 2022.

Wiz’s products will still work on competitor platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, the companies said. The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that the companies were in advanced discussions.

While the agreement may still draw government scrutiny, many on Wall Street have been hopeful that President Donald Trump’s new White House administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals. Alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over its online search dominance.

His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,2165,False
1jiqamw,23andMe files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as co-founder and CEO Wojcicki resigns,258,66,callsonreddit,2025-03-24 09:10:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jiqamw/23andme_files_for_chapter_11_bankruptcy_as/,0.97,False,False,False,"23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and its co-founder and CEO has resigned as the [struggling genetic testing company](https://apnews.com/article/23andme-layoffs-discontinues-drug-development-f1356699312d1e5c3915cf4fbc400374) continues its push to cut costs.

The company said Sunday that it will look to sell “substantially all of its assets” through a court-approved reorganization plan.

The San Francisco-based company also said Anne Wojcicki had resigned as CEO effective immediately but would remain on the company’s board. Her resignation comes a couple weeks after a board committee had rejected a nonbinding acquisition proposal from Wojcicki.

Shares of 23andMe Holding Co., which have shed nearly all their value since last spring, plunged below $1 in premarket trading Monday.

The voluntary bankruptcy filing caps months of turmoil for the company, which has struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021.

Last September, [all of its independent directors resigned](https://apnews.com/article/23andme-board-directors-resign-settlement-b3fda30fc8a95538f9391c5439c1cd52) in a rare move following negotiations with Wojcicki, who had been trying to take the company private.

The company then announced in November that it would lay off 40% of its workforce, or more than 200 employees, and discontinue its therapeutics division.

In January, the board’s special committee said it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible sale.

Board Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement Sunday that the company has determined that a court-supervised sale was “the best path forward to maximize the value of the business.” He said they also expect it to help the company’s efforts to cut costs and also resolve legal and leasehold liabilities.

Jensen also said, “We are committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward, and data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.”

23andMe plans to continue operating its business and has $35 million in debtor-in-possession financing from JMB Capital Partners.

1jecbuv,Nvidia announces Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips,238,24,Puginator,2025-03-18 14:40:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jecbuv/nvidia_announces_blackwell_ultra_and_vera_rubin/,0.93,False,False,False,"Nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday. 

CEO Jensen Huang revealed Blackwell Ultra, a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year, as well as Vera Rubin, the company’s next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, that is expected to ship in 2026.

Nvidia’s sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. That’s because its “big GPUs” have most of the market for developing advanced AI, a process called training.

Software developers and investors are closely watching the company’s new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the company’s biggest end customers — cloud companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon — to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around Nvidia chips.

Tuesday’s announcements are also a test of Nvidia’s new annual release cadence. The company is striving to announce new chips on an every-year basis. Before the AI boom, Nvidia released new chips every other year. 

The GTC conference in San Jose, California, is also a show of strength for Nvidia. 

The event, Nvidia’s second in-person conference since the pandemic, is expected to have 25,000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the company’s hardware for AI. That includes Waymo, Microsoft and Ford, among others. 

Nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event. 

For example, Nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips, including two AI-focused PCs that will be able to run large AI models such as Llama or DeepSeek. The company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of GPUs together so they work as one.

Vera Rubin

Nvidia said on Tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its next-generation GPU family in the second half of 2026. 

The system has two main components: a CPU, called Vera, and a new GPU design, called Rubin. It’s named after astronomer Vera Rubin.

Vera is Nvidia’s first custom CPU design, the company said, and it’s based on a core design they’ve named Olympus. 

Previously when it needed CPUs, Nvidia used an off-the-shelf design from Arm. Companies that have developed custom Arm core designs, such as Qualcomm and Apple, say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance.

The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in last year’s Grace Blackwell chips, the company said. 

When paired with Vera, Rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference, more than double the 20 petaflops for the company’s current Blackwell chips. Rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory, which is one of the core specs that AI developers watch.

Nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a GPU. Rubin is actually two GPUs, Nvidia said. 

The Blackwell GPU, which is currently on the market, is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip.

Starting with Rubin, Nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip, it will refer to them as separate GPUs. In the second half of 2027, Nvidia plans to release a “Rubin Next” chip that combines four dies to make a single chip, doubling the speed of Rubin, and it will refer to that as four GPUs.

Nvidia said that will come in a rack called Vera Rubin NVL144. Previous versions of Nvidia’s rack were called NVL72.

Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia also announced new versions of its Blackwell family of chips that it calls Blackwell Ultra.

That chip will be able to produce more tokens per second, which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor, Nvidia said in a briefing.

Nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use Blackwell Ultra to offer a premium AI service for time-sensitive applications, allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the Hopper generation, which shipped in 2023.

Blackwell Ultra will come in a version with two paired to an Nvidia Arm CPU, called GB300, and a version with just the GPU, called B300. It will also come in versions with eight GPUs in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 Blackwell chips.

The top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of Blackwell chips as Hopper chips, Nvidia said.

DeepSeek

China’s DeepSeek R1 model may have scared Nvidia investors when it was released in January, but Nvidia has embraced the software. The chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products.

Many AI observers said that DeepSeek’s model, which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the U.S., threatened Nvidia’s business.

But Huang said earlier this year that DeepSeek was actually a good sign for Nvidia. That’s because DeepSeek uses a process called “reasoning,” which requires more computing power to provide users better answers. 

The new Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin chips are better for reasoning models, Nvidia said. 

It’s developed its chips to more efficiently do inference, so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment, Nvidia’s chips will be able to handle it.

“In the last 2-3 years, a major breakthrough happened, a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened, we call it agentic AI,” Huang said. “It can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem.”

1jhe6r8,Tesla’s End-of-Lease Vehicle Accounting: How Falling Resale Values Impact Liabilities (2024-2025),234,38,th8aburn,2025-03-22 13:48:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jhe6r8/teslas_endoflease_vehicle_accounting_how_falling/,0.85,False,False,False,"I recently came across a post discussing Tesla’s leasing model and its implications for the company’s financials. Given the current negative sentiment around Tesla—due to Elon Musk’s controversial actions and statements—I decided to dig into the numbers using Deep Research. One of the biggest concerns right now is **the sharp decline in Tesla’s resale values**, which has significant implications for its leasing business and financial obligations.

# What Happens When Tesla Lease Vehicles Are Returned?

Tesla offers both **direct leases** (where it owns the leased vehicle) and **third-party leases** (where banks own the car, and Tesla guarantees a minimum resale value). When leases end, Tesla either:

1. **Resells the vehicle as a used car** (increasing “Services and Other” revenue).
2. **Releases it for another lease** (keeping it on its balance sheet as an asset).
3. **Buys back the vehicle under resale value guarantees** if a third-party lessor is involved.

# How Tesla Accounts for End-of-Lease Vehicles

1. **Operating Lease Vehicles, Net (Balance Sheet Asset):**
   * As of **December 31, 2024**, Tesla reported **$5.58 billion** in vehicles leased to customers (net of depreciation).
   * This asset declines as Tesla sells off or re-leases vehicles.
2. **Resale Value Guarantees (Potential Liability):**
   * Tesla **guarantees** buybacks for some leases.
   * Their maximum **end-of-lease exposure** under these guarantees **ballooned to $1.45 billion** in late 2024, up from just $166 million in 2023.
   * Despite this, Tesla reported the actual booked **liability as “immaterial”**—which now seems questionable given resale price drops. I expect this to be burred in the next earnings release so I'm keeping an eye on this.

# Tesla’s Resale Value is Crashing—How Does This Affect Liabilities?

Historically, Tesla’s used car prices were strong, allowing them to resell lease returns at a good margin. However:

* **Used Tesla prices plunged \~10-15% YoY**, especially for Model 3 and Y.
* This is due to **increased competition (Rivian, BYD, Hyundai, Ford)**, falling EV demand, and **Musk’s reputation issues driving away some buyers**.
* **Tesla is now selling used cars for LESS than their assumed residual values** in many cases.

# 🚨 Why This is a Big Problem 🚨

1. **Tesla May Need to Take Write-Downs on Leased Vehicles**
   * If actual resale values **drop below Tesla’s estimated residual values**, they have to recognize an **impairment charge** on their books.
   * So far, they’ve **avoided** reporting major write-downs, but Q1/Q2 2025 earnings could reflect this.
2. **Resale Value Guarantees Become Costly**
   * Tesla promised to buy back certain third-party-leased cars at pre-agreed prices.
   * If market values are far lower, **Tesla takes the loss**—this could hit margins hard.
3. **Profitability of the Leasing Model Declines**
   * With resale values falling, leasing becomes **less profitable**, or Tesla is forced to raise lease prices to compensate.
   * Tesla’s financing arm may need to adjust **future lease residual values downward**, which **hurts growth** in this revenue stream.

# What to Watch For in Tesla’s Next Earnings Reports

* **Are they recognizing a provision for lease impairments?**
* **Has the resale value guarantee liability increased?**
* **Are they slowing down new lease originations due to higher residual risk?**

# Final Thoughts

Tesla has gotten away with minimal provisions for lease losses so far, but the reality of **falling resale prices** could force them to take a hit soon. If the used Tesla market doesn’t recover, **expect impairments and higher lease-related losses in 2025**.

This is not financial advice — just a curious Redditor sharing their research. For transparency, I do hold some long puts expiring in September and I’ve been selling weekly puts ahead of earnings while implied volatility is elevated. I don’t necessarily expect this upcoming earnings release to be the catalyst for a major sell-off, but I do think Q2 could look worse if something drastic isn’t done.

The framework will ""substantially increase the UAE's existing investments in the U.S. economy"" in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, and manufacturing, the White House said in a statement.

The White House did not outline how UAE investments would reach $1.4 trillion, with some of the deals unveiled as part of the framework having already been announced.

The only fully new deal appeared to be an investment by Emirates Global Aluminium in what would be the first new aluminum smelter in the United States in 35 years, the White House said, adding the plant ""would nearly double U.S. domestic aluminum production"".

""Developing a primary aluminium smelter in the U.S. has been part of EGA's ambitions for several years,"" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement.

The UAE, an oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S., is looking to deepen investment ties with Washington and is emerging as a global leader in AI, one of the sectors it is betting on to diversify its economy away from energy.

In September, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met former U.S. President Joe Biden, in the first visit of a UAE president to the White House, as the two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in areas such as AI, investments and space exploration.

Gulf sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's $330-billion Mubadala, are already big U.S. investors, and Trump and his family have business ties to the region.

OVAL OFFICE MEETING

Trump in January asked Saudi Arabia to spend upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, over four years, including purchases of military equipment, and said this month he likely would make his first trip abroad to the Gulf country to seal an investment agreement.

The deal, which could happen between this month or the next, would come at a time when Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's biggest economy, has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. The Gulf country is set to host diplomatic talks around Ukraine involving the United States and Russia next week.

The White House said on Friday the UAE agreement resulted from a meeting that Trump held on Tuesday with national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the Oval Office and a dinner that Vice President JD Vance and several cabinet members held with the UAE delegation, which included the heads of major UAE sovereign wealth funds and corporations.

Among the tie-ups highlighted on Friday was a partnership between UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners, for a $25 billion U.S.-focused initiative to invest in energy infrastructure and data centers. That had been previously announced two days ago.

A commitment by XRG, the international investment arm of UAE state oil company ADNOC launched in November, to support U.S. natural gas production and exports with an investment in the NextDecade liquefied natural gas export facility in Texas, had previously been made public last year by ADNOC, under Biden.

From what I understand, Google's Chrome browser is based off of Chromium, an open-sourced browser project. Microsoft's Edge browser and Opera's web browser are also based on Chromium.

How can Google be forced to ""sell"" something that is already available for anyone to use?

Yes, Google employees seem to be the ones who maintain the Chromium codebase, but why would anyone want to *pay* Google money just to take on the burden of having to maintain code that any other company can still benefit from?

And beyond that, even if Google sells their ""Chrome"" browser, can't they just *immediately* start building another ""Totally-Not-Chrome"" web browser that is also based off of Chromium?

I think I'm failing to see what the core legal problem here is. Chrome is just a web browser. Yes, it is bundled with Android devices, but users can still download any other browser and use that instead. Just like how plenty of Windows users used to immediately download Chrome, or Apple and Linux users used to immediately download Opera.

And now to the reason I'm even posting in this subreddit: **What effect, if any, would this have on Alphabet's stock price?**

If they can still sell it and immediately turn around and just build another web browser... Doesn't that effectively mean free money into Alphabet's pocket from whoever makes the purchase?

This sixth-generation aircraft is set to replace Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor air superiority fighter jet.​

The NGAD program is a cornerstone of the USAF’s strategy to maintain air superiority in the face of evolving global threats. The program is designed as a “family of systems,” with the sixth-generation fighter jet as the central element. The crewed aircraft will be designed to operate seamlessly alongside unmanned drones, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), to execute various missions.

While specific design details remain classified, the aircraft is anticipated to feature stealth capabilities, advanced sensors, and next-generation propulsion systems. The engineering and manufacturing development contract, valued at over $20 billion, positions Boeing to receive additional orders potentially worth hundreds of billions over the program’s multi-decade lifespan.

This contract award represents a pivotal victory for Boeing, particularly benefiting its fighter jet production facility in St. Louis, Missouri. The company has faced challenges in both its commercial and defense sectors in recent years. In January 2025, when presenting its fourth-quarter 2024 results, Boeing disclosed an additional $1.7 billion in defense-related charges. The NGAD contract is expected to serve as a foundational component of Boeing’s defense business moving forward, especially as its F/A-18 production line approaches closure.

The selection of Boeing over Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of both fifth-generation fighters currently operated by the USAF, namely the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II, marks a significant shift in the defense contracting landscape. The move is particularly notable in light of Lockheed’s exclusion earlier in March 2025 from the US Navy’s F/A-XX program, its next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter competition, which left Boeing and Northrop Grumman as the remaining contenders

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/ram-owner-wants-to-bring-cheaper-pickup-back-to-us-cfo-says

Stellantis NV thinks there’s still demand for an affordable version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck in the US market after the stripped-down “Ram Classic” ceased production last year, Chief Financial Officer Doug Ostermann said.

“We need to introduce kind of a lower-end trim of the new pickup to fill that gap,” Ostermann said at a Wolfe Research conference on Tuesday, cautioning that it would not come to market “immediately.”

Dodge Ram is owned by Stellantis NV, a multinational automotive corporation formed on January 16, 2021, following the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group (Peugeot). This merger created Stellantis, which now oversees a vast portfolio of brands, including Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, and Peugeot.

In 2024, Stellantis faced significant challenges, including a sharp decline in U.S. sales, leading to a 16% drop despite overall market growth. 

This downturn was partly attributed to aggressive cost-cutting measures under CEO Carlos Tavares, such as reducing popular Jeep models, which some believed harmed long-term demand. These strategies led to internal disagreements, culminating in Tavares’s abrupt resignation in December 2024.  ￼ 

Additionally, labor tensions escalated when Stellantis filed a federal lawsuit against the United Auto Workers (UAW), alleging violations of their contract due to strike threats.  

In 2025, Stellantis unveiled plans to revitalize the Dodge brand lineup and detailed a strategy emphasizing increased marketing expenditures, competitive incentive programs, and the introduction of more affordable vehicle trims.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,1717,False

Rheinmetall's shares price could double to 3,000 euros by 2030 if European defense spending reaches 3% of gross domestic product, Morgan Stanley analysts Marie-Ange Riggio and Ross Law say. The German arms maker could potentially receive cumulative orders of between 325 billion euros and 450 billion euros by the end of this decade. Achieving this would force the group to double its manufacturing capacity starting in 2027, but that would be feasible, they add. The analysts estimate that Rheinmetall had a 12% share of the European equipment market in 2024, and an upward trend in market share is likely to continue as land platforms remain in focus in the near future. This could be confirmed by the European Commission's defense white paper, set to be published Wednesday.

Klarna, the buy now, pay later lender that’s headed for an initial public offering, said on Thursday that it’s signed on DoorDash as a partner, another sign of momentum for public market investors.

It’s DoorDash’s first BNPL alliance in the U.S. and gives users of the restaurant delivery service a new way to pay for meals and products. Klarna said in a press release that DoorDash customers will be able to pay in full at checkout, split payments into four equal interest-free installments, or defer to dates that align conveniently with payday schedules.

Klarna, which is headquartered in Sweden, filed its prospectus last week to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Revenue last year increased 24% to $2.8 billion, and adjusted operating profit was $181 million, swinging from a loss of $49 million a year earlier. CNBC reported on Monday that Klarna will be the exclusive provider of buy now, pay later loans for OnePay, the Walmart-backed fintech company.

“Our partnership with DoorDash marks an important milestone in Klarna’s expansion into everyday spending categories,” said David Sykes, Klarna’s chief commercial officer, in Thursday’s release.

Klarna, founded in 2005, said in its prospectus that it has 675,000 merchant partners in 26 countries. It’s among the most hotly anticipated IPOs of the year following an extended stretch of historically little activity for new offerings.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,1603,False

The company expects its full-year revenue to be flat to slightly down year over year, compared to the prior forecast of approximately flat.

It now expects adjusted profit to be in a range of $18.00 to $18.60 per share, from its previous outlook of $19.00 to $20.00 each.

1jem929,"Nvidia, GM announce deal for AI, factories and next-gen vehicles",86,16,Puginator,2025-03-18 21:55:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jem929/nvidia_gm_announce_deal_for_ai_factories_and/,0.91,False,False,False,"General Motors and Nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its next-generation vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems and factories.

The companies on Tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using Nvidia compute platforms, including “Omniverse with Cosmos,” for optimizing GM’s factory planning and robotics.

The Detroit automaker also said it will use “Nvidia Drive AGX” for “in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.”

GM declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with Nvidia. The tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business, which has notably included substantial work in data centers and GPUs.

“The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we’re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they’re made,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, said in a release. “We are thrilled to partner with GM to build AI systems tailored to their vision, craft and know-how.”

GM has been using Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, for training AI models across various areas of its business, including simulation and validation. The new business expands to in-vehicle hardware, automotive plant design and operations, the companies said.

The automaker also had been testing Nvidia’s Omniverse since at least 2022. Some of GM’s testing was in designing a “digital twin,” or replica, of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development. It also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in, according to a video last year featuring GM for Nvidia’s GTC developer conference in 2023.

Nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with GM mid-last year for Omniverse, according to an internal company email viewed by CNBC. At that time, two sources with GM signaled the automaker wasn’t sure Nvidia’s software and GPUs were worth the high cost compared with other companies.

It wasn’t immediately clear what sealed the deal for GM. But since that time, both companies have experienced increased competition from China and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs. GM’s stock is off roughly 8% during in 2025, while Nvidia is off about 12% this year.

“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in Nvidia’s release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.”

The companies announced the new initiatives in connection with Nvidia’s GTC AI conference this week in California.

Nvidia describes Omniverse as a platform for “developing and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications.” It’s essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital, or software, world to optimize processes using a “digital twin” of a physical environment such as a GM design facility or plant.

Users of Nvidia’s Omniverse have included BMW, Amazon Robotics and Samsung, Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology, said during a media briefing a year ago. He said the company was licensing Omniverse for $4,500 per GPU, per year.

It’s unclear how many GPUs GM will need. But given the amount of robotics, sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant, it would likely be quite a bit.

More than 20 other automakers have used Nvidia’s “system on a chip” hardware in the central computing units of their smart vehicles, including Mercedes Benz, Volvo, Audi, Volkswagen and BYD, according to an industry equity research note from Jeffries in November 2023.

In recent years, Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its GPUs, which are used for everything from bitcoin mining to AI inference and training.

The company expects the deal to close in the second half of 2025, according to a statement.

Carlyle Group and Oracle both have committed to selling their stakes in Ampere, SoftBank said.

Ampere will operate as an independent subsidiary and will keep its headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the statement said.

“Ampere’s expertise in semiconductors and high-performance computing will help accelerate this vision, and deepens our commitment to AI innovation in the United States,” SoftBank Group Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son was quoted as saying in the statement.

The startup has 1,000 semiconductor engineers, SoftBank said in a separate statement.

Chips that use Arm’s instruction set represent an alternative to chips based on the x86 architecture, which Intel and AMD sell. Arm-based chips often consume less energy. Ampere’s founder and CEO, Renee James, established the startup in 2017 after 28 years at Intel, where she rose to the position of president.

Leading cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services offers Graviton Arm chip for rent that have become popular among large customers. In October, Microsoft started selling access to its own Cobalt 100 Arm-based cloud computing instances.

1je3mot,Games Workshop Stock: Is Warhammer worth more than Star Wars when acquired by Disney?,54,67,JCRUZ_z,2025-03-18 08:21:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1je3mot/games_workshop_stock_is_warhammer_worth_more_than/,0.73,False,False,False,"This post is in relation to Games Workshop (LON: GAW), the \~£4.66 billion (\~$5.93B USD) tabletop gaming titan behind Warhammer.

My thesis: Warhammer’s universe, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem are worth *more* than GAW’s current market cap *and* what Disney paid for Star Wars in 2012 ($4.05B, or $5.54B in 2025 dollars).

I know this might sound bold. One can say that Warhammer’s a niche , not a mainstream beast like Star Wars was. However, as someone that's been closely monitoring latest developments of Warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore, a rabid fanbase, and catalysts like Henry Cavill’s Amazon series, this could be a sleeper hit the market’s undervaluing.

Let’s break it down.

GAW is the king of tabletop wargaming, crafting Warhammer universes—*40k* (grimdark sci-fi), *Age of Sigmar* (fantasy), and *The Old World* (retro fantasy). Founded in 1975 by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone with *Owl and Weasel*—a newsletter that became *White Dwarf* in 1977—it’s been building lore for 50 years. Today, it’s a £145/share stock with:

* **Market Cap**: £4.66B ($5.93B).
* **Revenue (2024)**: £577.5M ($735M), up 15.6% CAGR over 5 years.
* **Margins**: 71% gross, 41% operating, 30% net—insanely efficient.
* **Cash**: £125.8M, net debt negative (-£79.4M).
* **P/E**: 27.1—pricey, but growth justifies it.

Warhammer’s niche: 1-2M players dropping $200-500/year on minis, paints, and books. It’s not Disney’s scale, but it’s a moat—high-margin, loyal, and sticky.

# The Thesis: Warhammer’s IP is worth more than $5.9B (and Star Wars’ 2012 Price). GAW’s $5.9B cap reflects a tabletop business, but Warhammer’s IP (its lore, brand, and potential) could fetch $9-10B if sold to a Disney/Amazon/Netflix. (*)

*\[\*Edit: I am just trying to* ***value*** *WH's IP and $GAW, not saying I want it to be sold or anything.\]*

Why?

It’s a 50-year universe with untapped multimedia juice, and it’s firing on all cylinders in 2025. Let’s compare:

* **Disney’s Star Wars Deal**: $4.05B in 2012 ($5.54B today) got Lucasfilm—six films, $4.4B box office, $20B in merchandise, 35 years of lore. Disney turned it into $12B+ by 2024.
* **Warhammer Today**: No films (yet), but $735M revenue, 50 years of history and a lore deeper than Star Wars—10,000 years of *40k*, Chaos Gods, Space Marines, plus *Old World* nostalgia. Licensing’s just $38M—5% of revenue—but it’s a powder keg.

**Valuation Math**:

* Core revenue ($735M) x 8 (media IP multiple) = $5.88B.
* Licensing upside ($500M/year from films/TV, Star Wars-scale) x 5 = $2.5B.
* 50-year brand premium = $1-2B.
* **Total**: $9-10B—above GAW’s cap and Star Wars’ 2012 price.

Crazy? Maybe. But Warhammer’s fans are deep into it. Warhammer’s got potential.

# Why Now? 2025 is lighting up:

1. **Warhammer 40k 10th Edition**:
   * Launched June 2023, drove 10.8% core revenue growth in 2024 ($490M). Half-year to Dec 2024: 16.4% up ($307.5M).
   * X buzz (Q1 2025): “warhammer"" traffic’s 12-15M/month, up 10-20% from Q4 2024.
   * Potential: $75M/year growth through 2026.
2. **Henry Cavill’s Amazon Series**:
   * Deal locked Dec 2024: Cavill stars/produces a *40k* cinematic universe.
   * Licensing ($38M now) could double to $76M by 2027, with $40M+ indirect sales if 200K newbies buy armies.
3. **The Old World Resurgence**:
   * Jan 2024 launch, new faction drops (and rumours regarding Cathay).
   * People +30 are getting back to Warhammer. Veterans spending $50-250/army per year
4. **Hachette’s Combat Patrol**:
   * Launched Sept 2024 (UK), Jan 2025 (Spain via Salvat). Weekly mag with minis hooks newbies.
   * Launched in US too.

# Warhammer vs. Star Wars?

Warhammer’s no Star Wars, yet. Star Wars had mass appeal; Warhammer’s a cult with 1-2M players. But:

* **Lore**: 50 years, denser than Star Wars’ 35 in 2012. *Black Library* churns 20+ novels/year—*Horus Heresy* alone is 60+ books.
* **Fanbase**: Smaller but fanatic—players co-create (painting, campaigns). Star Wars sold toys; Warhammer sells a lifestyle.
* **Upside**: Star Wars had films in the can; Warhammer’s a blank slate. Cavill’s series could be its *Force Awakens*.

Some say Warhammer's too niche. I say it has a potential future mass craze.

$9-10B is what a buyer pays for potential, not just today’s market cap.

* **Now**: £145, P/E 27, 4.2% dividend yield. Fair value: £150-160 (EPS $5.35 to $6).
* **Bull Case**: Revenue hits $850M by 2027 (Cavill, *Old World*), EPS $9, P/E 25 = £225—50% upside.
* **Buyout**: A $9B bid spins the IP to Amazon, triples licensing in 5 years.

Risks? Cavill flops, *Old World* fades—growth slows to 5%, stock stalls at £150. But GAW’s 67% ROIC and monopoly scream resilience IMO.

1jgk4l0,FedEx shares slide as annual forecast cuts stoke worries on economy,51,2,callsonreddit,2025-03-21 11:55:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jgk4l0/fedex_shares_slide_as_annual_forecast_cuts_stoke/,0.85,False,False,False,"(Reuters) -FedEx's shares fell 11% on Friday after the parcel delivery firm cut its annual forecasts, fanning worries about the health of U.S. manufacturing amid uncertainty from the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on trading partners.

CEO Raj Subramaniam warned a day earlier that the company was navigating a very ""challenging operating environment"" and ""weakness in the industrial economy"" was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes.

The company's shares hit their lowest in nearly two years on Friday. FedEx and rival UPS are viewed as barometers for the global economy due to their involvement across a swathe of industries.

Shipments from companies that produce goods used in manufacturing drive substantial cargo volumes and high-margin deliveries for the delivery firms.

UPS' shares were down 3%, while European peer DHL fell 2.2%.

U.S. President Donald Trump's on-and-off import tariffs have created uncertainty for businesses, prompting them to be more cautious with their spending in an uncertain economic landscape.

Analysts have said Trump's levies could trigger a recession and a trade war, further hammering demand for transportation and delivery services.

""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business,"" Morgan Stanley said, adding that it may even overwhelm the company's cost-cutting program.

FedEx has been reducing costs as demand for lower-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies such as Temu and Shein outpaces higher-margin business-to-business shipments.

""Management noted weakness in the industrial economy and, while macro is a factor, we believe structural forces are a far bigger headwind than the market thinks,"" Morgan Stanley added.

The company lowered its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $18.00 and $18.60, from $19 to $20 previously.

The forecast cut itself was far from a surprise, but the magnitude, particularly for one remaining quarter, was greater than feared, Evercore ISI said.

At least 10 brokerages cut their price targets on the company's stock on Friday.

1jfa3t2,Why Investing in Canadian Small-Caps Sucks – Naked Short Selling Explained,47,17,10baggerss,2025-03-19 18:44:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfa3t2/why_investing_in_canadian_smallcaps_sucks_naked/,0.77,False,False,False,"I’ve heard a ton about naked short selling over the years, and I kind of understood what it was, but I never really got why it’s such a big issue in Canada. After looking into it more, it’s pretty clear this is something anyone investing in Canadian small caps should at least be aware of.

Short selling itself isn’t the problem. That’s just when someone borrows shares, sells them, and buys them back cheaper to return to the lender. If they guess right and the stock drops, they make money. It’s a normal market function.

Naked short selling is a whole different story. Instead of borrowing shares before selling, traders just sell them without actually owning or locating them. These shares don’t exist, but the sale still goes through, creating artificial selling pressure.

The issue is that when too many of these phantom shares hit the market, it makes it look like there’s way more selling than there actually is. The price drops, not because investors are actually dumping shares, but because the market is reacting to fake supply.

This is brutal for small caps, especially junior miners in Canada. Big stocks have enough liquidity to absorb short selling, but small stocks don’t. If there’s even a little naked shorting, it can completely crush a stock that should be moving up on good news.

Some companies are fighting back. Power Nickel filed complaints with regulators in late 2023, showing data that millions of their shares had been sold but never delivered. You’d think regulators would be all over that, but apparently not. They barely responded, and nothing really came of it.

Then there’s Save Canadian Mining, an advocacy group led by Terry Lynch and backed by investors like Eric Sprott and Rob McEwen. They’ve been pushing for tougher enforcement, arguing that Canadian regulators have let this problem spiral out of control.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has actually started cracking down. In 2023, a legal change made brokers responsible for their clients’ illegal naked shorting. If a trader sells shares they don’t own and it causes damage to a company, the broker can now be held legally accountable. That forces brokers to actually pay attention instead of just looking the other way.

Canada hasn’t caught up. There’s been talk about changing the rules, but no real action. Companies keep getting hammered by what should be illegal short selling, and investors are left wondering why their stocks never move, even when the fundamentals look solid.

So where does this go from here? In the U.S., lawsuits against brokers are picking up, and firms are being forced to take this issue more seriously. In Canada, it’s still business as usual. Either regulators start enforcing the rules properly, or companies are going to have to take matters into their own hands.

Curious to hear what others think. Have you seen this play out in any stocks you follow? Do you think regulators will actually do anything, or is this just how things are always going to be?",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,2979,False
1jgktpz,Rolls-Royce: From Crisis to Comeback,47,16,Lofi-Fanboy123,2025-03-21 12:24:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jgktpz/rollsroyce_from_crisis_to_comeback/,0.84,False,False,False,"Alright folks, let’s talk about why Rolls-Royce (RR.L) might be one of the best investment opportunities right now. No, not the luxury car brand (though that’s cool too), but the aerospace and defense giant.

1. Massive Turnaround Story

A couple of years ago, Rolls-Royce was in a pretty rough spot. The pandemic crushed the aviation industry, and since a big chunk of RR’s revenue comes from servicing jet engines, they took a serious hit. But fast forward to now, and they’ve staged one hell of a comeback. New leadership, aggressive cost-cutting, and a booming post-pandemic travel industry have turned things around.

2. Strong Financials & Profitability

The latest earnings reports have been fire. Profits are soaring, debt is being reduced, and they’re finally in a position where cash flow is strong. Rolls-Royce is now expecting operating profits to grow substantially in the coming years. This isn’t just some hyped-up stock; the numbers back up the bullish case.

3. Defense & Nuclear Expansion

While most people know Rolls-Royce for its commercial aviation business, their defense segment is a gold mine. Governments worldwide are ramping up military spending, and RR is benefiting big time from increased defense contracts. Also, their work on small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) could be a game changer. If the world really wants to go green while maintaining energy security, nuclear is the way forward, and RR is positioning itself as a key player.

4. Undervalued Compared to Peers

Despite the recent rally, Rolls-Royce still looks undervalued when compared to other aerospace giants like General Electric and Safran. If they continue executing well, there’s a lot more room for growth.

5. Analyst Upgrades & Institutional Interest

Big banks and hedge funds are starting to take note. More analysts are upgrading their price targets, and institutions are increasing their holdings. This is a good sign that the “smart money” sees RR as a solid long-term play.

The Bottom Line

Rolls-Royce isn’t some moonshot meme stock; it’s a real company with strong fundamentals, a solid turnaround story, and serious long-term potential. If you’re looking for a stock that has both growth potential and a defensive backbone, RR might just be your best bet right now.

Not financial advice, but worth a look if you’re into smart investing.

Some AI improvements to voice assistant Siri will be delayed until 2026, Apple had said earlier this month without giving any reason for the delays.

Mike Rockwell, vice president in charge of the Vision Products Group, will now be in charge of the iPhone maker's Siri virtual assistant as CEO Tim Cook has lost confidence in AI head John Giannandrea's ability to execute on product development, the report said.

Rockwell, known as the brain behind Apple's Vision Pro headset, will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing Siri completely from Giannandrea's command, according to Bloomberg.

Paul Meade, an executive who has run hardware engineering for the Vision Pro under Rockwell, will take over VPG, the report added.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.

Last year, Apple announced a range of AI-driven features called Apple Intelligence that included new capabilities such as rewriting emails and summarizing a cluttered inbox.

Overall caused a small selloff in INTC but nothing major- recently the more major catalyst was the new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The market mainly considered this a rumor so interesting to see it still cause a small move. Overall not too interested unless we sell off more. TSM's clear denial of interest in acquiring INTC's foundries shows that they're not really interested in bringing more production to the US or really partnering with a US solution. Overall more of a interesting geopolitical note.

TSMC news came from Digitimes (a daily industry newspaper from Taiwan on the semicondcutor industry)

[**TUR (Turkey ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TUR&p=d)\- The arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent rival to President Erdoğan has led to a significant selloff in the Turkish lira and Turkish assets. We've fallen close to 10% overnight in TUR, the Turkey ETF. Overall this likely won't see recovery for a few months. Last coup I remember was back in 2016 and it took a few months for TUR to recover (and it didn't do so linearly) so ultimately not interested in this. Continued political unrest and potential sanctions could further devalue Turkish assets, but I doubt there will be any outside intervention. EEM (the emerging markets ETF) seems to be unaffected overall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) **-** California's Public Utilities Commission has granted TSLA a transportation charter-party carrier permit, allowing the company to transport employees in company-owned vehicles, marking a step towards potential public ride-hailing services.

At the same time, Tesla has been able to pull off decent profit margins off of selling carbon credits to traditional auto manufacturers ($2.76 billion in 2024). They will have even more to sell in 2025 which could offset a drop sales/ deliveries in their earnings report.

Do you think the stock will correct or tank on poor earnings?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Required info to start understanding options:

* [Call option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp) basically a call option allows you to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to buy
* [Put option Investopedia video](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp) a put option allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price), but without the obligation to sell
* Writing options switches the obligation to you and you'll be forced to buy someone else's shares (writing puts) or sell your shares (writing calls)

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

News: [US Treasuries Fall on Signs That Trump Will Dilute April Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/us-treasuries-fall-on-signs-that-trump-will-dilute-april-tariffs)

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs—interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.

[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).

Backlog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. 

[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&p=d)\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.

News: [London's Heathrow Airport Shut Friday Due To Power Outage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/london-s-heathrow-airport-shut-friday-due-to-power-outage)

Overall, mainly earnings today.

[**NKE (Nike)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NKE&p=d) \- EPS of $0.54 vs. $0.30 expected. Revenue of $11.3B vs. $11.02B expected. Despite beating expectations, sales/profits declined YoY in NA/China/Online. NKE gave a negative earnings outlook, and stated Q4 revenue would decline low-to-mid-teens (10-15%), mainly due to margin pressure from new tariffs. Pretty brutal move. I remember earnings from last year were pretty bad mainly due to weaker demand in China/Online segments. Overall a victim of tariffs, I don't consider this investible for now but things will change if we get any new news regarding tariffs, which are the main headwinds here. IIRC 25% of NKE's shoes are made in China.

[**NIO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&p=d)**-** Revenue of $2.7B in Q4 2024. Vehicle deliveries rose 45.2% YoY (including Onvo vehicles). Net loss widened to RMB 7.11B, a 32.5% YoY increase. Despite the increase in cars sold, they suffered a loss of \~$1B. They've never been profitable since they've started, so reading a little deeper into their reports, there's still concern about liquidity due to current liabilities being higher than current assets this year (a very bad sign when you want to borrow). They cited EV demand in China remains strong, especially in the premium BEV segment. NIO holds a 40% market share in the $40K-$50K car segment (I'm rounding here after conversion).

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**/Quantum Computing stocks**\- Announces that they will be building a quantum lab in Boston. This has moved all the quantum computing stocks to the downside- obviously NVDA has market power in whatever industry they want to enter and compete in and most companies interested in quantum computing will likely prefer their services over the rest of the smaller players. Was the ""quantum computing is a decade away"" comment a brutal play to make the quantum computing sector weaker before his entry? If so, then bravo, that's Game of Thrones worthy scheming.

[**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)**,** [**UAL (United Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UAL&p=d)**,** [**JBLU (JetBlue Airways)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JBLU&p=d)\- London Heathrow fire triggered power outage, delaying around 1,300 flights. Operational impact could cause a minor selloff in airlines that have heavy presence there. Nothing too interesting I'm watching, but I think it's worth noting if we see continued slowdowns and ripple effects from this.  Delays and reroutes raise operational costs (like we saw in the CRWD outages affecting airlines last year).",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,3225,False

Despite oil prices slipping 2% year to date, the S&P 500 Energy Select ETF ([XLE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLE/)) is up nearly 8%, while Tech ([XLK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLK)) and Consumer Discretionary ([XLY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLY)) are down more than 8% and 12%, respectively.

""The energy sector continues to offer compelling investment characteristics, including high free cash flow yields and investor friendly capital allocation through cash dividends, dividend growth, and stock buybacks,"" said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.

Energy-related equities may be partially insulated from the recent tariff and inflation uncertainty, which has impacted growth stocks.

""I think tariffs will have less impact on the energy sector than on others,"" said Simon Lack, portfolio manager for the Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund ([MLXAX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MLXAX)), noting it's unlikely that other countries will impose tariffs on US energy exports.

A favorable regulatory environment under President Trump is also expected to lower production costs for energy companies.

""Additionally, he has signaled a willingness to reconsider tariffs if other countries buy more US oil and gas, reinforcing a positive outlook for the sector,"" Lack said.

Bullish price movements in natural gas ([NG=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NG=F/)), the star performer within the energy complex, have also sent equities within the sector higher.

""These companies are benefiting from a more than 30% increase in natural gas prices in 2025,"" Thummel noted.

Plains All America Pipeline ([PAA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAA/)), for example, is up 17% year to date, while MPLX ([MPLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MPLX/)), a natural-gas pipeline transportation company, is also up about 12% since the start of the year.

On Friday, oil was on pace for its second week of gains after touching its lowest level of the year earlier this month, with Brent ([BZ=F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BZ=F)), the international benchmark, hovering above $71 per barrel.

""Our model indicates Brent prices in the low $70s are about $6 undervalued,"" JPMorgan's Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note on Thursday.

""We expect Brent prices to rise to the mid- to high-$70s in the coming months, then fall below $70, ending the year in the mid-$60s, averaging $73.""

First and foremost, I am a novice investor. However, I want a discussion to develop myself and I want to hear your view on this company.

I recently discovered Verve Group when my buddy from Germany recommended it. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on it. The stock is currently trading at 37 SEK (approx. $3.70 USD). Market cap is 625 M.

Verve Group is a digital media firm that uses AI-driven solutions to optimize advertising by connecting advertisers with publishers. Led by CEO Remco Westermann. What is remarkable is that Remco owns almost 25% of the company.

Verve’s Q4 2024 was strong, with 24% organic growth and full-year revenue reaching €437m, exceeding forecasts.

Many analysts have given a buy recommendation to this, while target price is something between 50-60$.

This update follows my previous DD post, which was removed but is now eligible for reposting.

Despite the move, **CAPR remains significantly undervalued** given its upcoming **FDA decision (PDUFA: Aug 31, 2025)**, its **revenue share with Nippon Shinyaku (30-50%)**, and **a likely $1.2M per patient per year price tag** for Deramiocel.



**Deramiocel U.S. Pricing – Now Expected at $1.2M Per Year**



📌 **From Capricor’s March 2025 Investor Deck:**

• 15,000–20,000 DMD patients in the U.S.

• 200,000 DMD patients worldwide

• $27B+ market size by 2030

• **Target reimbursement price: $1.2M per year (higher than initial expectations)**



🔹 **Comparable Rare Disease Drug Pricing:**

• **Zolgensma** (one-time gene therapy): **$2.1M**

• **Elevidys** (one-time gene therapy for DMD): **$3.2M**

• **Deramiocel** (quarterly infusions, ongoing treatment): **$1.2M per year**



Unlike one-time gene therapies, Deramiocel is **a recurring treatment**, meaning **consistent revenue potential for CAPR**.



**Post-Earnings Takeaways**

✅ **Cash runway secured into 2027** – **$152M cash on hand**.

✅ **Milestone payments from Nippon Shinyaku** – $10M received, **$80M expected upon approval**.

✅ **FDA Priority Review** – **PDUFA date set for Aug 31, 2025**.

✅ **Revenue Model** – **30-50% share of net sales revenue** from Nippon Shinyaku.

✅ **Manufacturing expansion underway** – preparing for **commercial launch**.



CAPR’s stock popped on this **fundamentally strong report**, yet it **remains well below fair value**.



**Stock Holding Strong Despite Market Selloff**

Since my **March 5 post**, the major indices have **dropped sharply**:

📉 **Dow Jones:** \-2.17% (42,518.37 → 41,593.96)

📉 **NASDAQ:** \-4.59% (18,312.97 → 17,472.00)

📉 **S&P 500:** \-3.10% (5,781.36 → 5,602.00)



Meanwhile, **CAPR surged post-earnings, now around $14.36**, showing **continued accumulation**.



**Updated Valuation: What’s CAPR Worth?**

If **Deramiocel is priced at $1.2M per patient**, CAPR’s revenue share could be **$900M–$1.5B annually**.



📌 **Revenue Breakdown:**

• **Conservative estimate:** 2,000 U.S. patients + 500 EU patients

• **Annual treatment cost:** $1.2M per patient

• **Total potential revenue:** **$3B/year**

• **CAPR’s share (30-50% per agreement with Nippon Shinyaku):**

• **Low-end (30%):** $900M/year

• **High-end (50%):** $1.5B/year



📌 **Other Cash Inflows:**

• **Priority Review Voucher (PRV):** Likely worth **$100M–$150M**

• **Milestone Payments from Nippon Shinyaku:** **Up to $1.5B total**, some paid on approval



**Valuation Based on Revenue Multiples**

Biotechs typically trade at **5-10x peak revenue once commercialized**.

• **$900M revenue → Market Cap: $4.5B – $9B**

• **$1.5B revenue → Market Cap: $7.5B – $15B**



📌 **Implied Stock Price Range:**

• **Low-end estimate:** **$90/share**

• **Bull case:** **$200+ per share**



At **$14.36/share (\~$630M market cap)**, CAPR **remains priced as if Deramiocel will fail**. If successfully approved and commercialized, it could still **5x-10x+ from here**.



**Options & Short Interest Update**

📌 **Short Interest:** **Still elevated (\~20% of float)** – A forced short cover could add **fuel to upside moves**.

📌 **Options Positioning:** **Bullish activity remains strong**.





**Updated YOLO Position 🚀**

Since my last post, I’ve **added more** to my position and now hold **935 September $15 Calls**.

📌 **Cost Basis:** $5.41 per contract

📌 **Market Value:** \~$551,650

📌 **Day Gain:** **+$144,925 (35.63%)**



**Final Thoughts**

🔥 **TL;DR:** CAPR **surged post-earnings**, but it’s still undervalued.

• **$1.2M drug pricing confirms upside is even higher than initially estimated.**

• **Market skepticism on Nippon Shinyaku’s sales ability may be holding it back.**

• **Strong financials + clear FDA path = Still a 5-10x potential.**



If **August approval happens**, expect a **major re-rating event**. 🚀

Container freight rates have plunged in 2024, roughly halving from about $4,000 per standard container at the year’s start to around $2,000 now. This slide was briefly interrupted by a price surge when conflict in the Red Sea forced ships onto longer detours around Africa, driving up rates in early 2024. However, that spike has faded, and analysts warn that a full return to normal routes could unleash excess capacity and cause freight rates to collapse.

Exacerbating the pressure on rates is a wave of new ships entering service. The global container fleet expanded by over 10% (adding nearly 3 million TEU of capacity) in 2024 – a record influx that has flooded the market with tonnage and intensified downward pressure on pricing. So far, the Red Sea detours have absorbed much of this excess capacity, preventing a glut, but as routes normalize that surplus will return to the market. Carriers might attempt to counter overcapacity with blank sailings, idling, or scrapping older vessels, but these measures are unlikely to be enough to prevent freight rates from sinking further.

These industry headwinds are squeezing Hapag-Lloyd’s financial results, shrinking profit margins and eroding the windfall gains of the pandemic shipping boom. The company’s net profit in 2024 was about €2.4 billion – down nearly 19% from the prior year and a far cry from its record €17 billion profit in 2022. Hapag-Lloyd’s management has cautioned that the environment remains fragile, and it expects earnings in 2025 to be even lower than in 2024 amid volatile rates and geopolitical uncertainties. If freight rates remain at or below today’s depressed levels, the carrier faces further margin erosion and a potential “perfect storm” of prolonged low rates undermining its post-pandemic profitability.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,1928,False

We are profoundly saddened to share that a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has passed away following treatment with ELEVIDYS, having suffered acute liver failure. Acute liver injury is a known possible side effect of ELEVIDYS and other AAV-mediated gene therapies and is highlighted in the prescribing information. Although it is not a new safety signal and the benefit-risk of ELEVIDYS remains positive, acute liver failure (ALF) leading to death represents a severity of acute liver injury not previously reported for ELEVIDYS, which to date has been used to treat more than 800 patients in clinical trials or as a prescribed therapy.

>In addition, testing revealed this patient had a recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection which was identified by the treating physician as a possible contributing factor. CMV can infect and damage the liver, a condition known as CMV hepatitis.

>Patient safety and well-being are Sarepta’s top priority. We continue to gather and analyze the information from this event. The event has been reported to the relevant health authorities and Sarepta intends to update the prescribing information to appropriately represent this event. We have also reported the event to ELEVIDYS clinical study investigators and prescribing physicians.

>ELEVIDYS (delandistrogene moxeparvovec-rokl) is a single-dose, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene transfer therapy for intravenous infusion designed to address the underlying genetic cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy – mutations or changes in the DMD gene that result in the lack of dystrophin protein – through the delivery of a transgene that codes for the targeted production of ELEVIDYS micro-dystrophin in skeletal muscle.

“We recently signed agreements with partners like May Mobility, Mobileye and Marubeni to start rolling out AVs on our platform as soon as this summer,” Jeremy Bird, executive vice president of driver experience at Lyft, wrote in a Thursday (March 20) blog post. “And over time, AVs will account for a larger share of cars, and a larger percentage of rides.”

Bird wrote this in a blog post addressing how the debut of AVs may affect the drivers who offer rides through the platform. He wrote that while Lyft doesn’t have all the answers, the company expects that there will still be opportunities for drivers because the addition of AVs won’t necessarily mean there will be fewer rides to be served by drivers.

“Adding cars to our platform — whether they’re driven by humans or AVs — improves arrival times and creates a better rider experience,” Bird wrote. “That gets people to take more rides, creating more opportunities for drivers.”

Lyft CEO David Risher wrote a blog post in February focusing on the rideshare company’s role in the emerging AV ecosystem.

Risher wrote that the company expects to contribute its core competencies having to do with asset ownership and financing, fleet management, the mobility platform and marketplace, and rider demand and experience.

“Our world-class fleet management, sophisticated marketplace engine and large-scale demand represent the best way for AV companies, OEM manufacturers and fleet owners to commercialize their assets,” Risher wrote. “We partner with those companies to bring exceptional autonomous transportation experiences to riders at scale.”

It was reported in February that Lyft aimed to bring autonomous robotaxis to its app in 2026. The company said at the time that the robotaxi service would launch first in Dallas, with the goal of scaling the service to thousands of vehicles across multiple cities following that rollout.

Risher said during a Feb. 11 earnings call: “AVs will be a transformational addition to the marketplace. “We’ll start in Dallas and we do expect to move into other markets.”

After hearing the Nvidia GTC keynote I want to get more into AI/data center stocks because I do believe this is a great space for big profits and the future is clearly heading in the direction to utilize these products and services.

  
The 4 stocks that I've been looking at are:

\- Broadcom (AVGO)  
\- Service Now (NOW)

\- Cadence (CDNS)

\- Applied (APLD)

  
I currently invest in mainly all mega cap stocks and dont have much % of my portfolio in AI/data center.

I do have NVDA and AMD at the moment, but pretty small positions.

  
I like the idea of having a few more speculative low cap stock like APLD and I like how NVDA backed them with some funding, which shows me they have some faith in that company. Can get a good amount of shares and hold for a big rally up if the company takes off in the future. Something that I dont need to put a lot of money into which can have a massive increase.

I also like the other 3 because of a few different reasons, but I noticed they had some very large rallies recently, for example NOW.

I liked Cadence because what Jensen said yesterday that they would be looking to hire a lot of designers from Cadence for all their future needs, which makes me believe that company has something special Jensen sees in them.

  
I want to know what you guys think about these 4, or any other AI/Data center stocks you know of that would be good to watch. Im pretty unfamiliar with the AI space and im gathering as much information as I can on this subject.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,1636,False

Shares of Australian shipbuilder Austal Ltd. climbed after a unit of Hanwha Aerospace Co. became a substantial shareholder in the company, as the Korean defense firm aims to bolster its reach.

Austal’s stock rose as much as 9.7% in Sydney trading on Tuesday, its largest jump since Feb. 21, after a subsidiary of Hanwha acquired a 9.9% stake in the firm. The Korean company also applied to the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board to increase its holding to 19.9%, it said in a statement.

Hanwha purchased 41.2 million Austal shares at A$4.45 per share, according to an exchange statement, a 16% premium from Monday’s close.

The move is part of an effort by the Asian defense giant to expand its presence in the region, with the sector receiving renewed interest from investors amid expectations of revenue boosts from increased military expenditure globally. Hanwha Aerospace’s stock has more than doubled this year and is one of the top gainers on Asia’s equity benchmark.

Hanwha unsuccessfully attempted to buy the Australian company last year. In April, the Korean firm said no further discussions were underway, though it was working to continue talks with Austal’s management and board on its acquisition proposal.

I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

I’ve read a few books on stock options trading when I considered doing it (not considering anymore) and it always surprised me why people would do it because it seems way more risky, and more importantly, much much more difficult. In stock options you often have to deal with not just the risk of the stock’s price move, but also implied volatility, time decay and delta. And on top of that, you risk losing the entire premium paid for the option if the stock’s price doesn’t go over/under your strike price, and these premiums can get very expensive if you lose a couple of bets in a row.

Obviously there’s multiple different ways you could combine these options to lower or amplify your risk, but to me that just gives more points of risk/failure of losing your investment if you don’t consider and do the proper DD.

This is not to say people shouldn’t trade options, I’m just not smart enough to trade them profitably. But for those of you who do trade options, how profitable has it been for you and how much more difficult is it than simply trading stock equity (and is the increased difficulty worth it?).",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,1277,False

That puts the fair value share price around $25. 

Recent data from various sources indicate that the global auto industry P/E ratio typically ranges between 15 and 20 when considering a broad set of companies. However, Tesla's significantly higher P/E ratio—often cited above 100 (161.23 as of March 17, 2025)—skews the industry average upward when included. Excluding Tesla, the average P/E ratio for traditional automakers tends to be much lower, reflecting their more established, slower-growth business models compared to Tesla's growth-oriented valuation.Focusing on major automakers excluding Tesla, here are some representative P/E ratios based on recent data:

* Toyota: Approximately 9.7
* General Motors (GM): Around 9.13
* Ford: About 6.74
* Honda: Around 7.3
* Stellantis: Approximately 6.5
* Volkswagen (VW): Around 4.0
* Hyundai: Approximately 2.9

These figures indicate that traditional automakers have P/E ratios typically in the single digits to low teens. To estimate the average P/E ratio excluding Tesla, we can take a simple average of these representative companies:

* (9.7 + 9.13 + 6.74 + 7.3 + 6.5 + 4.0 + 2.9) / 7 = approximately 6.61

However, broader industry analyses (e.g., from Simply Wall St or Nasdaq) suggest that the U.S. or global auto industry average, when Tesla’s outsized P/E is excluded, typically falls between 8 and 12, depending on the sample of companies and market conditions. The U.S. auto industry's 3-year average P/E is noted at 72.0x, but this is heavily influenced by Tesla; without it, the average drops significantly, aligning closer to the 8-12 range cited. Given the variability and the lack of a single definitive dataset in the provided references, a reasonable estimate based on the data is:

* Average P/E ratio in the automotive industry, excluding Tesla: Approximately 8 to 12, with a midpoint around 10.

This range reflects the lower valuations of traditional automakers, which are less growth-focused than Tesla, and is consistent with current sentiment and comparative financial metrics as of March 20, 2025. For a more precise figure, additional data from a comprehensive set of automakers would be needed, but this range provides a solid approximation based on available information.

I’m sure all of us, including myself purchase from their brand, as we grab the cheapest black pepper or chili pepper spice we can find. 

They’re a slow moving giant trying to prove that they can attain growth. To justify their P/E of 27.4 which is 20%+ higher than their competitors. 

Recently with Trump’s tariffs, doubling on China to 20%, this company will be hit quite hard. 
McCormick in end of February till now, has received 499 shipments from China + HongKong. Which equates to their highest import from country, second place is Sri Lanka with 268 and third is Spain with 229. FYI these shipments are in thousands of tonnes, very large. 
(https://www.importinfo.com/mccormick-co-inc)

This news isn’t a surprise, Walmart their biggest customer is pushing back on all suppliers to eat some of the tariff costs so consumers don’t take the hit. If you haven’t noticed, McCormick hasn’t had many hot sales in the spice isles in US stores. I visited Kroger and only sales I found is cheaper brand names. This tells me, they’re likely starting to feel the heat from both sides, consumers and suppliers.

Some more information, there’s lots of Reddit forums where people around the world are boycotting US products. This will harm their international market growth.

Interesting enough, world wide spice prices are dropping MoM. This is a result of US disrupting the demand market. Likely as US companies are requesting farmers to drop their prices, they face demand issues. So they lower them some amounts, yet other countries reap the real benefits of buying them for less (no tariffs).

I don’t think $MKC will drop 20% in a day. 
I expect a modest correction that will take a week or two, bleeding the stock from $80 to $65, to a healthy P/E of 20 and dividend yield closer to 3.5%.

1. What percent in the negatives is considered good to buy at when ""buying low"" (1 understand buying low comes with the risk of them not coming back up but l'm more comfortable with this option because I only have 600$ to put into stocks right now)
2. I'm looking to buy low and probably never sell and just let them grow and add smaller amounts weekly/monthly as my budget allows.
I don't necessarily want to watch to see when stocks are high to sell, If eel like l'd rather just keep buying when lower??? Idk man

I assume everyone and their mother’s is trying to identify when the stock market or major indices have reached the bottom of this current decline and will begin to rebound.

My question is not about timing the market per se, but rather a question about what, if any, pieces of evidence or indicators may show us that the bottom has been reached. Is there anything that we can learn from historical market corrections that maybe can guide us in identifying this.

For example, if you were to see three or four consecutive green days in the S&P 500, would that be enough to make you feel like things are behind us? What about if the S&P 500 were to close 5% above its year-to-date lows? Would that be enough to convince you?

Would it be better to invest a little less and save more, since I don’t have a ton of savings, though I won’t really need the money now, savings aren’t that high. Would it be better to invest a little less and save more? Sell some and diversify? If so, what would be good diversification options? Or even any other advice?

BUT, do you know what’s not going to disappear? Uber!

Oh but Waymo will just launch its own ride sharing platform and same with Tesler (the best all computer mode of transportation on the market). This is the counter point we generally hear to Uber’s relevance in the next 10+ years. 

This fails to take into account two things: 
1) Making a self driving car is incredibly difficult until it’s not. 
2) We are 10+ years minimum until full self driving is widespread enough to be a global everyday option.
3) Companies don’t care about monopolies they care about making money and return on investment.

Point 1: Same thing people were saying with Tesla and electric vehicles. First mover advantage, by the time everyone catches up Tesla will be a million miles ahead of everyone. We now see that it’s not that hard once the foundational level tech has been developed and eventually all cars will have an electric vehicle if they want. 

Point 2: We are so far away from full self driving being an everyday part of global life that there is an incredible amount of cash burn still required and companies will compete to make the best self driving car, NOT spending ungodly amounts of money playing 20+ years of catchup on Uber. Keeping in mind that Uber continues to evolve and find new ways to screw their customers (incredibly bullish 🤑)

Point 3: This goes hand in hand with point 2. There is still a tremendous amount of cash burn with self driving car companies such as Waymo and the easiest path to commercialisation is partnering with Uber. They will choose return on investment instead of monopolies every time and we are bringing to see this with Waymo. 

Also good financials, finally profitable, gross bookings up blah blah blah boring.

Stock is up +8% today (+25% YTD). If you’re into sports betting you might be interested by this one.

Sportradar is a powerhouse in the sports data industry, providing crucial real time stats and insights that they provide to sports betting companies (>2/3 of revenue), media outlets, and even sports leagues themselves. They just made a big move by acquiring the IMG Arena rights, continuing to consolidate the space.

In my view it's a proper ""pick-and-shovels"" of the sports betting boom, whatever sport betting app you use, they are providing the data for most leagues (MLB, NBA, ATP, UEFA,...) . With global sports viewership on the rise, I see them enjoying several more years of double-digit growth. Plus, as they scale, their margins are set to expand. Their free cash flow generation doubled in 2024, and they’re expecting an even better conversion rate in 2025.

I will admit the valuation is getting a bit steep, but at 20x EV/EBITDA it's still reasonable for the growth potential.

I am new to the investing world, and I am learning a lot.  
I am finding myself asking questions about some forms of ""investment"", that I really only see as ""speculation"" really (that is, buying something only for selling it later on at an higher price).

In my head, ""investing"" is about putting money in an asset which have good possibilities to grow, and make a profit out of it. This seems quite the case for the stock market if you aim at buying stocks that give dividends. But not all companies pay dividends on their stocks. In that case, I am buying stocks ""only"" to sell them later on at an higher price. So that's to me is ""betting"" on the stock price to raise.  
That seems to me not different from ""investing"" in gold or oil, or crypto, or in any asset that can have some ""value"" changing over time, and that can be paid off at a certain moment.  
Also, the money I am getting when I want to ""cash out"" are always from the market (i.e., other investors, small or big, but almost never from the company - buy backs are exception in this scenario).  
Sometimes it seems to me like a Ponzi scheme, I can't really say why.

So, my question is: am I seeing it right? Is investing in stocks, most of the time, just buying some assets with the hope they will increase in value? And with the hope there will be some other investor willing to give me money for me to ""cash out""?

(I know that one can buy commodities or stocks, or even currencies, and consider them an asset, and ""do things"" with them, but in practice it's very difficult to pay in stocks, and one must always get back to a common ground - currency - to make everyday's life transactions - buying bread, putting gas in your car, ...).

Certain eras in market history earned the nickname “lost decade” because stock prices failed to sustainably recover for 10 years or more. The most notable and often cited examples are:

* **1929**: The Great Depression. Stocks crashed nearly 90%. It took WWII to revive the economy.
* **1970s**: Sky-high inflation, oil shocks, and 20% interest rates. Stocks went nowhere for a decade.
* **2000–2010**: The dot-com bubble burst, then the financial crisis hit. Markets didn’t recover for years.
* **Japan (1989–Present)**: A popped asset bubble led to decades of stagnation—Japan’s market only just surpassed its 1989 high.

Lost decades usually share common traits: 1) overvalued markets, 2) too much debt, 3) major economic disruptions, 4) policy missteps, and 5) weak productivity.

So, how does today compare?

* **Valuations?** Elevated, but not dot-com crazy. Big Tech is actually wildly profitable.
* **Inflation?** Cooling and much more controlled —nothing like the runaway 1970s.
* **Debt?** Government debt is high, but households and corporates are healthier than in 2008.
* **Demographics?** Aging, but still younger and more dynamic than Japan.
* **Geopolitics?** Tense, but markets are absorbing it (so far).
* **AI & tech?** This might be the wild card. If AI boosts productivity like some expect, it could drive real growth and massive wealth creation—unlike past lost decades, which lacked this kind of engine.

There *are* risks. We might see lower returns ahead in the coming decade. But the world is not falling apart. This isn't the same setup as the 1970s or 2008.

So ignore the noise. A 10% correction isn’t the end of the world. Keep investing through the ups and downs in high quality companies for the long-term. ",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,2103,False

The investors are frightened by the tension in the politics and the tariffs may influence the dynamics of the markets thoroughly. Seeing that the uncertainty can stay for some more time, no more new positions have been added by both retail and institution investors in crypto and many other risky markets.

  
Nothing stays the same forever. The markets are eager to go up as the risk of inflation is no longer possible in the U.S. economy and the developing countries and the wars might be close to being permanently over.

The negative atmosphere in the markets is majorly related to the poor performance of the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 indices. The fear that the tariffs may slow down the U.S. economy which may give birth to slower growth of the economy and less profit margins for the companies has been the major narrative investors follow.

The uptrend starting in 2023 is violated with the downward breakout in NDX.

Potentially, we may see the bloodbath going on until the levels are around 18.4K or even 16.7K. In the positive scenario, the violation of the channel can be temporary with a strong "" god candle"" which enters the price back to the uptrend. In such a case, expecting the prices around the previous ATH would not be surprising.

To be able to stay positive, we have to find another story to attract the new investors who would buy the assets from the current prices. For crypto, it is almost ATL for many coins whereas for the stock exchanges, we are still not there yet.

In an optimistic scenario, the certainty of the tariffs can be the first driving force that can terminate the downtrend in the risky markets. The reciprocal tariffs have been hitting the markets badly as it is almost impossible to foresee where this cold war would end.

  
We may have tasted the word days and the ""fear"" may be over.

A slightly bullish scenario in macroeconomics can trigger a stronger bull leg pretty soon. I am hopeful for the sentiment in April.

What do you think about the tariffs' impact on the markets?

So it seems to me that AUM is basically individuals' money at the end of the day and the institutions are just holding the money to provide administrative services or maybe give some ""guidance"" but the final decision is made by individuals.

1jfidz3,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,0,10,notllmchatbot,2025-03-20 02:08:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/,0.39,False,False,False,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",stocks,2025-03-24 14:36:59.582638,3334,False

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/) pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the [Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

There's a lot of backstory to the narrative of Chinese stocks- we've seen the Chinese government try to inject stimulus into the economy, the US has tried to end the de minimis rule, China's trying to encourage more business (remember the meeting of Xi/business leaders), etc. Overall China is trying to let the private sector operate a little more freely to stave off an economic downturn.

President Donald Trump’s coming wave of tariffs is poised to be more targeted than the barrage he has occasionally threatened, aides and allies say, a potential relief for markets gripped by anxiety about an all-out tariff war.

Trump is preparing a “Liberation Day” tariff announcement on April 2, unveiling so-called reciprocal tariffs he sees as retribution for tariffs and other barriers from other countries, including longtime US allies. While the announcement would remain a very significant expansion of US tariffs, it’s shaping up as more focused than the sprawling, fully global effort Trump has otherwise mused about, officials familiar with the matter say.

Trump will announce widespread reciprocal tariffs on nations or blocs but is set to exclude some, and — as of now — the administration is not planning separate, sectoral-specific tariffs to be unveiled at the same event, as Trump had once teased, officials said.

Still, Trump is looking for immediate impact with his tariffs, planning announced rates that would take effect right away, one of the officials said. And the measures are likely to further strain ties with allied nations and provoke at least some retaliation, threatening a spiraling escalation. Only countries that don’t have tariffs on the US, and with whom the US has a trade surplus, will not be tariffed under the reciprocal plan, an official said.

As with many policy processes under Trump, the situation remains fluid and no decision is final until the president announces it. One aide last week referred repeatedly to internal “negotiations” over how to implement the tariff program — and some of the most regularly hawkish signals come from Trump himself, underscoring his avowed interest in sharply raising import taxes as a revenue stream.
“April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America. We’ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe,” Trump said in the Oval Office Friday. It would bring in “tens of billions,” he added, while another aide said recently the tariffs could bring in trillions of dollars over a decade.

But the market reaction to initial tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China — as well as certain metals — has hung heavy over a West Wing serving a president who has long used major indexes as a measuring stick of his success.

Trump officials publicly acknowledged in recent days the list of target countries may not be universal, and that other existing tariffs, like on steel, may not necessarily be cumulative, which would substantially lower the tariff hit to those sectors. That includes comments from Trump himself, who has increasingly focused his remarks on the reciprocal measures.

It’s already a retreat from his original plans for a global across-the-board tariff at a flat rate, which later morphed into his “reciprocal” proposal that would incorporate tariffs and non-tariff barriers. It’s not clear which countries Trump will include under his more targeted approach. He has cited the European Union, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India and China as trade abusers when discussing the matter, an official said.

While narrower in scope, Trump’s plan is still a much broader push than in his first term and will test the appetite of markets for uncertainty and a raft of import taxes.

“There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect, and the president will be announcing those himself,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.

Markets Overestimating

Kevin Hassett, Trump’s National Economic Council director, said markets are overestimating the scope.
“One of the things we see from markets is they’re expecting they’re going to be these really large tariffs on every single country,” he told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, who held Hassett’s job during Trump’s first term.

“I think markets need to change their expectations, because it’s not everybody that cheats us on trade, it’s just a few countries and those countries are going to be seeing some tariffs.”


Trump has also pledged to pair those with sectoral tariffs on autos, semiconductor chips, pharmaceutical drugs and lumber. The auto tariffs, specifically, he said would come in the same batch. “We’re going to do it on April 2nd, I think,” he said in a February Oval Office event.

But plans for those remain unclear and, as of now, they aren’t set to be launched at the same “liberation day” event, officials said.

An auto tariff is still being considered and Trump has not ruled it out at another time, officials said. But excluding the measure from the April 2 announcement would be welcome news to the auto sector, which faced the prospect of as many as three separate tariff streams straining supply chains.

The “liberation day” event might also include some tariff rollbacks, though that’s uncertain. Trump imposed, then heavily clawed back, tariffs on Canada and Mexico for what the US said was a failure to slow shipments of fentanyl destined for the US. The fate of those remains deeply unclear: a Trump pause on swathes of those tariffs is due to expire, but the tariffs could be lifted entirely and replaced with the reciprocal number, officials said.
‘Dirty 15’

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that steel and aluminum tariffs may not necessarily add on to the country-by-country rates. “I will have a better sense as we get closer to April 2nd. So, they could be stacked,” he told Fox Business last week.

In the same interview, he said it’s roughly 15% of countries that are the worst offenders.

“It’s 15% of the countries, but it’s a huge amount of our trading volume,” he said, referring to it as the “dirty 15” and signaling they are the target. “And they have substantial tariffs, and as important as the tariff or some of these non-tariff barriers, where they have domestic content production, where they do testing on our — whether it’s our food, our products, that bear no resemblance to safety or anything that we do to their products,” he said.
Trump aides considered, before abandoning, a three-tiered option for global tariffs, where countries were grouped in based on how severe the administration considered their own barriers, people familiar with the plans said. That option was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.
Trump sees tariffs as a key tool both to steer new investment to the US and to tap new sources of revenue, which he hopes to offset tax cuts Republicans are considering.

“Tariffs will make America more competitive. They will incentivize investment into America,” Stephen Miran, Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers chairman, said in an interview, declining to detail the steps.

The White House has also argued that trillions of dollars in pledged announcements by foreign countries and companies provides evidence Trump’s plans are working. Miran told Fox Business last week that talks are ongoing ahead of April 2nd deadline.

“I do think that it’s perfectly reasonable to expect that we could raise trillions of dollars from tariffs over a 10-year budget window and like I said before, using those revenues to finance lower rates on American workers, on American businesses,” he said.

Still, economists have questioned whether the tariffs would meaningfully impact the deficit, particularly considering the risk of inflation or an economic slowdown.

Companies could also adapt, especially if not all countries are subject to the levies. US customs revenues from China surged after the tariffs were imposed in 2018, according a survey last year by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, but then peaked in 2022 and dropped sharply in 2023.

This has killed sentiment dropping the stock to uncanny low levels.

A few assumptions:

1. Analysts expect Revenue 3 years out are expected to be 200 billion. 

2. Tesla has had a P/S multiple between 6 and 28 historically

I built a matrix pricing Tesla between 6 to 10x sales and looked at sales of 150,180,200,210,225 (-25%,-10%,base,5%,12.5%) on that revenue estimate

This yields a market cap of 900 to 2,250 or a 3 year return ranging between 7.47% and 45.86% per year! They have also had minimal dilution in recent years.

I know I know, Elon is doing irreparable harm to the Tesla brand! It’s just like chipotle with ecoli, VW cheated on emissions, Equifax leaking all our data, Wells Fargo opening accounts and so on. 

DOGE is set to terminate in July of 2026 starting the distancing from Trump

For better or worse, fair or unfair, Tesla likely has a regulatory advantage in getting FSD approved thanks to Elon’s position. 

Overtime I expect Tesla will be valued like Apple, not legacy auto. Why? Well for one, Tesla doesn’t have a banking arm so that makes it far different than legacy auto for comparisons. Apple has lumpy iPhone sales followed by big fat juicy service revenue. Tesla, at maturity has the same potential. Lumpy car sales with subscriptions to FSD, Insurance, App Store, robo-taxi, repairs and maintenance, etc. this is the reason I used 6-10x sales above. These are around the multiple Apple has been valued at in recent years.

Additionally, the following is True:

They sell cars at retail prices to consumers whereas legacy auto sells cars wholesale to dealers.

They are one of the few to make EVs profitable at scale and have been wise to lower prices to levels legacy auto can’t compete at.

Tesla has many call options on its business with robotics and FSD

Never mix politics and portfolios

Best of Luck!
