1jbv5dh,The Mar-A-Lago Accord - they are crashing the market AND the dollar,2856,148,big-papito,2025-03-15 09:30:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jbv5dh/the_maralago_accord_they_are_crashing_the_market/,0.91,False,False,False,"So I've posted around this paper by Stephen Miran, ringing the alarm bells regarding what they are trying to do: [https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199\_A\_Users\_Guide\_to\_Restructuring\_the\_Global\_Trading\_System.pdf](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf)

He is Trump's new chief economic adviser. Guess what? The word ""tariff"" appears here 215 times. This is the plan. This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - ""pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.""

This has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord. It's not a name of some conspiracy theory. This policy paper mentions ""Mar-A-Lago Accord"" as a thing: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gillian-tett.html)

You are not crazy - they tried to impose tariffs on our allies, the allies balked, and now the crew is salty and disorganized. They don't know what to do. Hilariously, Miran predicted this himself (this is in the summary, p.37, read it):

>These policies may supercharge efforts of those looking to minimize exposure to the United States. Efforts to find alternatives to the dollar and dollar assets will intensify. There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.

Dionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:

1jalltg,Stocks Tumble Into Correction as Investors Sour on Trump,2214,414,Shalaiyn,2025-03-13 16:17:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jalltg/stocks_tumble_into_correction_as_investors_sour/,0.93,False,False,False,"he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

Together, four top officers at the company have offloaded over $100 million in shares since early February.

Last week, longtime Musk ally James Murdoch -- the estranged son of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch and a board member since 2017 -- became the latest to do so, exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately $13 million, according to an SEC filing. The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.

According to one filing, the shares were sold ""to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.""

Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.

The chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.

A number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.

""Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,"" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.

However, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.

""Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,"" Ritter said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.

""While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,"" Goldstein said.

The share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.

ABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.

Tesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.

> White House aides are preparing to impose new tariffs on most imports on April 2, laying the groundwork for an escalation in global economic hostilities that President Donald Trump has called “Liberation Day.”
> 
> Through his first two months in office, the president has raised tariffs on roughly $800 billion in imports from China, Mexico and Canada, although estimates vary widely. These tariffs have sent the stock market careening and raised the risks of a U.S. recession, while inviting retaliation against domestic industries by trade partners.
> 
> Despite the blowback, senior Trump advisers are now publicly pledging to create a new tariff regime that would impose new duties on trade with most countries that trade with the United States. A person familiar with internal planning, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations, confirmed administration officials are preparing tariffs on “trillions” of dollars in imports.
> 
> The potential to more than double the scope of Trump’s tariffs has alarmed economists and some congressional Republicans, while other White House allies are concerned about the logistical challenges of a complicated new import tax regime. The precise nature of these new duties has spurred extensive discussions at the highest levels of the administration, with Vice President JD Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House aide Peter Navarro and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent all playing a role in the talks, the person familiar with the plans said.
> 
> ""The last two months have already hurt American businesses and consumers, but the April 2 deadline seriously could make all of that look like a tempest in a teapot,” said Joseph Politano, an economic policy analyst at Apricitas Economics. “We don’t know exactly what they’re going to do, but from what they’re saying, it sounds functionally like new tariffs on all U.S. imports.”
> 
> The internal preparations suggest Trump remains unbowed in his push to upend the global trade order, despite deepening unease among allies on Capitol Hill and Wall Street and outright fury from overseas. Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to encourage companies to move production back to the U.S. and force concessions from foreign trading partners, but the fallout has rattled investors and consumers, leading to declines in several key economic indicators.
> 
> “It’s a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries, including friend and foe,” Trump told reporters on Monday.
> 
> Trump has dubbed the next stage of his trade war “reciprocal tariffs.” The president first embraced the idea during his 2024 presidential campaign, arguing that other countries impose far higher trade barriers on U.S. exports than the U.S. government charges on imports. Trump has said the U.S. should match these tariffs with “reciprocal” duties that he believes will force other countries to lower their duties on U.S.-made products.

If there is an interest rate drop then we have bottomed and in for another bull run.

There is a prevailing theory, especially among the MAGA crowd, that Trump was playing 4D chess and tanking the market on purpose to get the Fed to drop rates, fulfilling a campaign promise and allowing Trump to refinance a large portion of the government debt at lower rates. I think most levelheaded investors don’t thing this is true. While I don’t agree with the hypothesis, we know that short-term moves in the market are generally not based on fundamentals. 

I also think that if Powell (edited) doesn’t drop rates (which is the expectation) then the next social media post that Trump makes will be something along the lines of “Powell needs to be fired” and that will add more uncertainty to the market. If anything, we mostly like Powell because he’s been so transparent. Do we know what a Trump appointed Fed chair would do?

Edit - in case I wasn’t clear enough. I don’t think the Fed will drop rates. But I do think Trump will make a fuss about it and suggest firing Powell. And the toddler fit he will throw will tank the markets.

> At the top of Berlin’s shopping list are six F127 battleships from Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems valued at more than €15 billion ($16.4 billion), and 20 added Eurofighter jets from BAE and its partners worth some €3 billion, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the procurement plans aren’t public.
> 
> The emphasis on European-made gear marks a departure from Germany’s previous €100 billion splurge in 2022.

1jf3fbr,"Fed holds interest rates steady, still sees two cuts coming this year",335,71,_hiddenscout,2025-03-19 14:05:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jf3fbr/fed_holds_interest_rates_steady_still_sees_two/,0.97,False,False,False,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fed-rate-decision-march-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/fed-rate-decision-march-2025.html)

The Federal Reserve in a closely watched decision Wednesday held the line on benchmark interest rates though still indicated that reductions are likely later in the year.  
  
Faced with pressing concerns over the impact tariffs will have on a slowing economy, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee kept its key borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December. Markets had been pricing in virtually zero chance of a move at this week’s two-day policy meeting.  
  
Along with the decision, officials updated their rate and economic projections for this year and through 2027 and altered the pace at which they are reducing bond holdings.  
  
Despite the uncertain impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs as well as an ambitious fiscal policy of tax breaks and deregulation, officials said they still see another half percentage point of rate cuts through 2025. The Fed prefers to move in quarter percentage point increments, so that would mean two cuts this year.  
  
In its post-meeting statement, the FOMC noted an elevated level of ambiguity surrounding the current climate.  
  
“Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,” the document stated. “The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.“  
  
The Fed is charged with the twin-goals of maintaining full employment and low prices.  
  
The committee downgraded its collective outlook for economic growth and gave a bump higher to its inflation projection. Officials now see the economy accelerating at just a 1.7% pace this year, down 0.4 percentage point from the last projection in December. On inflation, core prices are expected to grow at a 2.8% annual pace, up 0.3 percentage point from the previous estimate.  
  
According to the “dot plot” of officials’ rate expectations, the view is turning somewhat more hawkish on rates from December. At the previous meeting, just one participant saw no rate changes in 2025, compared to four now.  
  
The grid showed rate expectations unchanged over December for future years, with the equivalent of two cuts expected in 2026 and one more in 2027 before the fed funds rate settles in at a longer-run level around 3%.  
  
In addition to the rate decision, the Fed announced a further scaling back of its “quantitative tightening” program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet.  
  
The central bank now will allow just $5 billion in maturing proceeds from Treasurys to roll off each month, down from $25 billion. However, it left a $35 billion cap on mortgage-backed securities unchanged, a level it has rarely hit since starting the process.  
  
Fed Governor Christopher Waller was the lone dissenting vote for the Fed’s move. However, the statement noted that Waller favored holding rates steady but wanted to see the QT program go on as before.  
  
The Fed’s actions follow a hectic beginning to President Donald Trump’s second term in office. The Republican has rattled financial markets with tariffs implemented thus far on steel, aluminum and an assortment of other goods against U.S. global trading partners.  
  
In addition, the administration is threatening another round of even more aggressive duties following a review that is scheduled for release April 2.  
  
An uncertain air over what is to come has dimmed the confidence of consumers, who in recent surveys have jacked up inflation expectations because of the tariffs. Retail spending increased in February, albeit less than expected though underlying indicators showed that consumers are still weathering the stormy political climate.  
  
Stocks have been fragile since Trump assumed office, with major averages dipping in and out of correction territory as administration officials cautioned about an economic reset away from government-fueled stimulus and towards a more private sector-oriented approach.  
  
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan earlier Wednesday countered much of the gloomy talk recently around Wall Street. The head of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets said card data shows spending is continuing at a solid pace, with BofA’s economists expecting the economy to grow around 2% this year.  
  
However, some cracks have been showing in the labor market.  
  
Nonfarm payrolls grew at a slower than expected pace in February and a broad measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underemployed workers jumped a half percentage point during the month to its highest level since October 2021.",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,4668,False

Investors Want Reassurance It Will Act If Needed,290,74,s1n0d3utscht3k,2025-03-16 16:59:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jcvlcn/the_fed_is_in_waitandsee_mode_investors_want/,0.96,False,False,False,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-16/fed-meeting-this-week-has-investors-anxiously-awaiting-powell-s-remarks

Jerome Powell faces a tricky task this week of both assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing while also conveying policymakers stand ready to step in if necessary.

Even as the Federal Reserve chair has touted US resilience, uneasiness sparked by President Donald Trump’s rapidly escalating trade war has sent stocks tumbling over the past month. Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.

“Powell needs to give some sort of a signal that they’re watching it,” said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don’t target the stock market, they can’t ignore the recent slide, he warned.

The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers’ updated projections to show Wednesday. 

Some investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank’s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. 

“At the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. “But clearly they can’t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.” 

On top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America’s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn’t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a “period of transition,” and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a “detox.” ",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,2033,False
1je6elq,Google to acquire cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion,262,71,Puginator,2025-03-18 10:35:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1je6elq/google_to_acquire_cloud_security_startup_wiz_for/,0.94,False,False,False,"Google on Tuesday signed a “definitive agreement” to acquire Wiz, the New York-based cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash deal, according to releases.

The deal, which will be Google’s largest-ever acquisition, will improve its cloud security offering in a world of advancing artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats. Wiz will become a part of the company’s cloud business. Google said it expects to close the deal in 2026.

“Google Cloud is a leader in cloud infrastructure, with deep AI expertise and a track record of industry-leading security innovation,” Google said in a release. “Bringing all this to Wiz will help make their solutions even better and more scalable, benefiting customers and partners across all major clouds.”

The acquisition comes after CNBC reported in July that Wiz had walked away from a potential $23 billion acquisition by Google and announced to employees that it would pursue an initial public offering instead.

“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport wrote to employees in a July memo obtained by CNBC. At the time, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that Wiz walked away from the deal in part due to antitrust and investor concerns.

Before talks with Google were reported, Wiz had set its sights on two goals: an IPO and $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. In the memo at the time, Rappaport wrote that the company would pursue those milestones.

Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown rapidly under Rappaport, with the company hitting $100 million in annual recurring revenue after just 18 months. The company’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response, a portfolio that’s appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft, which also sells security software.

“Becoming part of Google Cloud is effectively strapping a rocket to our backs: it will accelerate our rate of innovation faster than what we could achieve as a standalone company,” Rappaport said in a blog post Tuesday.

Google has a long history in dealmaking and snatching up smaller companies to broaden its offerings to customers. Its largest deal before Wiz was the $12.5 billion acquisition of hardware marker Motorola in 2012. Two years later, the company sold some assets to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. Google has also made cybersecurity acquisitions in the past, paying $5.4 billion for Mandiant in 2022.

Wiz’s products will still work on competitor platforms including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, the companies said. The Wall Street Journal first reported Monday that the companies were in advanced discussions.

While the agreement may still draw government scrutiny, many on Wall Street have been hopeful that President Donald Trump’s new White House administration will be more amenable to tech industry deals. Alphabet is currently battling an antitrust suit over its online search dominance.

1jdcut4,US Retail Sales Rise by Less Than Forecast After January Drop,250,36,WinningWatchlist,2025-03-17 09:39:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jdcut4/us_retail_sales_rise_by_less_than_forecast_after/,0.96,False,False,False,">US retail sales rose by less than forecast in February and the prior month was revised lower, adding to concerns of a pullback in consumer spending.

>The value of retail purchases, not adjusted for inflation, increased 0.2%, Commerce Department data showed Monday. January data was marked down to a 1.2% decline, the biggest drop since July 2021.

>The retail report largely encompasses spending on goods, which is especially relevant now as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on a swath of imports from major trading partners — likely driving up prices. Economists have been marking down growth estimates in recent weeks.

>Seven of the report’s 13 categories posted decreases, notably motor vehicles — which were expected to rebound from a weak January. Gasoline sales, as well as those of electronics and apparel were also lower. Spending at restaurants and bars, the only service-sector category in the retail report, declined by the most in a year.

>Stock futures fluctuated and Treasury yields rose after the report.

>The figures add to evidence that consumer spending is dropping off as tariffs risk reigniting inflationary pressures and stalling economic growth. Companies, investors and economists are cautious on the outlook as consumer sentiment sours and signs of financial stress mount.

>Low-income consumers are already strapped for cash, and wealthier Americans may also pull back as a recent stock-market selloff discourages big investments.

>The retail data showed so-called control-group sales — which feed into the government’s calculation of goods spending for gross domestic product — increased 1% in February, reversing the prior month’s drop. The measure excludes food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations.

>A separate report Monday showed New York state manufacturing activity dropped in March to the lowest level since early 2024 while measures of prices picked up, consistent with expectations for slower growth and faster inflation as tariffs set in.

>Reconciling growth concerns, while also assuring investors the economy remains on solid footing, will be a key challenge for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week. He’s due to speak at the conclusion of the central bank’s meeting Wednesday, in which policymakers are expected to hold interest rates steady.

>Retailers including Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. have said they may have to raise prices because of Trump’s tariffs, whiles weak outlooks from companies like Kohl’s Corp. and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. are casting doubt about the strength of US consumers.

>The retail sales figures aren’t adjusted for inflation and largely reflect purchases of goods, which comprise a relatively narrow share of overall consumer outlays. February data on inflation-adjusted goods and services spending will be released later this month.

1jeqaup,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,245,184,notllmchatbot,2025-03-19 01:55:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/,0.76,False,False,False,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,2165,False
1jecbuv,Nvidia announces Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin AI chips,238,24,Puginator,2025-03-18 14:40:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jecbuv/nvidia_announces_blackwell_ultra_and_vera_rubin/,0.93,False,False,False,"Nvidia announced new chips for building and deploying artificial intelligence models at its annual GTC conference on Tuesday. 

CEO Jensen Huang revealed Blackwell Ultra, a family of chips shipping in the second half of this year, as well as Vera Rubin, the company’s next-generation graphics processing unit, or GPU, that is expected to ship in 2026.

Nvidia’s sales are up more than sixfold since its business was transformed by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. That’s because its “big GPUs” have most of the market for developing advanced AI, a process called training.

Software developers and investors are closely watching the company’s new chips to see if they offer enough additional performance and efficiency to convince the company’s biggest end customers — cloud companies including Microsoft, Google and Amazon — to continue spending billions of dollars to build data centers based around Nvidia chips.

Tuesday’s announcements are also a test of Nvidia’s new annual release cadence. The company is striving to announce new chips on an every-year basis. Before the AI boom, Nvidia released new chips every other year. 

The GTC conference in San Jose, California, is also a show of strength for Nvidia. 

The event, Nvidia’s second in-person conference since the pandemic, is expected to have 25,000 attendees and hundreds of companies discussing the ways they use the company’s hardware for AI. That includes Waymo, Microsoft and Ford, among others. 

Nvidia will also showcase its other products and services at the event. 

For example, Nvidia announced new laptops and desktops using its chips, including two AI-focused PCs that will be able to run large AI models such as Llama or DeepSeek. The company also announced updates to its networking parts for tying hundreds or thousands of GPUs together so they work as one.

Vera Rubin

Nvidia said on Tuesday that it expects to start shipping systems on its next-generation GPU family in the second half of 2026. 

The system has two main components: a CPU, called Vera, and a new GPU design, called Rubin. It’s named after astronomer Vera Rubin.

Vera is Nvidia’s first custom CPU design, the company said, and it’s based on a core design they’ve named Olympus. 

Previously when it needed CPUs, Nvidia used an off-the-shelf design from Arm. Companies that have developed custom Arm core designs, such as Qualcomm and Apple, say that they can be more tailored and unlock better performance.

The custom Vera design will be twice as fast as the CPU used in last year’s Grace Blackwell chips, the company said. 

When paired with Vera, Rubin can manage 50 petaflops while doing inference, more than double the 20 petaflops for the company’s current Blackwell chips. Rubin can also support as much as 288 gigabytes of fast memory, which is one of the core specs that AI developers watch.

Nvidia is also making a change to what it calls a GPU. Rubin is actually two GPUs, Nvidia said. 

The Blackwell GPU, which is currently on the market, is actually two separate chips that were assembled together and made to work as one chip.

Starting with Rubin, Nvidia will say that when it combines two or more dies to make a single chip, it will refer to them as separate GPUs. In the second half of 2027, Nvidia plans to release a “Rubin Next” chip that combines four dies to make a single chip, doubling the speed of Rubin, and it will refer to that as four GPUs.

Nvidia said that will come in a rack called Vera Rubin NVL144. Previous versions of Nvidia’s rack were called NVL72.

Blackwell Ultra

Nvidia also announced new versions of its Blackwell family of chips that it calls Blackwell Ultra.

That chip will be able to produce more tokens per second, which means that the chip can generate more content in the same amount of time as its predecessor, Nvidia said in a briefing.

Nvidia says that means that cloud providers can use Blackwell Ultra to offer a premium AI service for time-sensitive applications, allowing them to make as much as 50 times the revenue from the new chips as the Hopper generation, which shipped in 2023.

Blackwell Ultra will come in a version with two paired to an Nvidia Arm CPU, called GB300, and a version with just the GPU, called B300. It will also come in versions with eight GPUs in a single server blade and a rack version with 72 Blackwell chips.

The top four cloud companies have deployed three times the number of Blackwell chips as Hopper chips, Nvidia said.

DeepSeek

China’s DeepSeek R1 model may have scared Nvidia investors when it was released in January, but Nvidia has embraced the software. The chipmaker will use the model to benchmark several of its new products.

Many AI observers said that DeepSeek’s model, which reportedly required fewer chips than models made in the U.S., threatened Nvidia’s business.

But Huang said earlier this year that DeepSeek was actually a good sign for Nvidia. That’s because DeepSeek uses a process called “reasoning,” which requires more computing power to provide users better answers. 

The new Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin chips are better for reasoning models, Nvidia said. 

It’s developed its chips to more efficiently do inference, so when new reasoning models require more computing power at the time of deployment, Nvidia’s chips will be able to handle it.

“In the last 2-3 years, a major breakthrough happened, a fundamental advance in artificial intelligence happened, we call it agentic AI,” Huang said. “It can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem.”

Are these analysts politically motivated to prop up Tesla stock because they’re scared Elon Musk will ruin their firms, since he’s in the government now? That’s pretty selfish thinking in my opinion, and isn’t this kind of blatantly false analyst ratings considered market manipulation?


This is why I don’t follow analyst ratings on any stocks to make my financial decisions. In February, Tesla's sales slumped in the U.S., Australia, China, and several European countries. The fall was precipitous in some markets, including Germany, where sales collapsed by 76% last month, and Italy, where Tesla registered a 55% drop.

You’ve got Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, literally shilling Tesla stock on Fox News. Isn’t that illegal?

Tesla's stock price has sunk roughly 41% this year, although it remains up 46% over the last 12 months after surging in the weeks following Trump's electoral victory in November.

There, I made an argument why markets were overpriced due to valuations and the actions of the current administration.

I am still worried, and I'm wondering what are the counter-arguments. 

1. Valuations are still high. 
2. Trump admin and Musk are pushing austerity via spending cuts/mass layoffs. 
3. Unstable tariff policy. Companies and consumers can't plan ahead. April 2 is coming. More chaos or clarity?
4. Soft data has been terrible. 
5. High-frequency and corporate data (travel, retail) all point to a rapidly deteriorating consumer. 

All of that makes me worried we are headed for a recession. Banks seem to agree and have upped their forecasts for one. Three months ago this would have been laughable. 

Granted, this can all change on a tweet. The trump team can pivot, make tariffs more clear & targeted, and Doge can become more work and less theater. Then, we can get to beneficial tax policies & deregulation.

I'm concerned that's not gonna happen. 

I'm concerned that Trump tariffs wont make companies move to the US & create jobs as Trump, Lutnick, and Bessent think they will. I'm concerned that people will get fired and become more poor, things will get more expensive, and Trump team will have nothing to show for it. 


Now, to positioning & stocks:

I've been buying things that will benefit from protectionist policies, like INTC and X. I've also bought the dip on several big tech names & then sold them on Friday after the rally. Why? Take Nvidia, for example. Great company, but if chips aren't excluded from tariffs, then Nvidia's profit margins would get slashed. So would the valuation.

I'm sitting on a lump of cash & am waiting for more clarity, whether it's up or down.

The push by European governments to order European over US military equipment offers a further 80% upside to order intake, on our analysis,"" analysts said Monday. ""A faster timeline appears likely given geopolitical events in recent weeks, in our view. Reaching 3% of GDP by 2030 would offer a 12% CAGR in defence spending.""

Germany and the UK are set to significantly increase their defence budgets over the coming years, benefiting companies such as Rheinmetall ($RHM), the research firm's top pick; Renk Group ($R3NK); QinetiQ Group ($QQ); and Babcock International Group ($BAB).

As such, the research firm upgraded its rating on Babcock to buy from hold and raised the price target to 8.85 pounds sterling from 5.75 pounds, while boosting Rheinmetall's price target to 1,410 euros from 750 euros and maintaining its buy rating.

Yields on German bonds surged as government leaders agreed on a massive defense spending package, while the ultimate haven asset — gold — topped $3,000 for the first time.

>The almost 2% advance in the S&P 500 was set to be the biggest since the aftermath of the presidential election. Not even data showing a slide in consumer confidence prevented the market rebound. That follows a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the US equity benchmark from its peak. Treasuries trimmed a recent rally fueled by a flight to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 0.5% to $3,004.94 an ounce before erasing gains.

>The moves capped a week of drama that included Trump’s on-and-off-again tariffs, recession calls, geopolitical talks and concerns over a US government shutdown. Combined with all the questioning around lofty tech valuations, global equity funds saw their biggest redemption this year.

>“The markets are grappling with the notion of where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts, and potentially softening economic data, said Yung-Yu Ma at BMO Wealth Management. “Negative investor sentiment is building, so a multi-day relief rally could be coming soon.”

>Despite Friday’s advance, the S&P 500 still headed toward a fourth straight week of losses — the longest such streak since August. Trading volume was 10% below the average of the past month. Tech megacaps led gains on Friday, with Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. up at least 3.3%. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 2.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4%.

>The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.30%. A dollar gauge fell 0.2%.

>“We are seeing some oversold rally efforts once again,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we caution folks looking to dive back in at the first sign of stability here: nearly everyone is looking for a bottom and to ‘buy the dip’ at some point, but the current condition of the markets has not implied any real improvement on a technical basis - the tape is simply very oversold at this stage.”

>Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities says he gets asked multiple times a day: “Is the worst over?”

>“We don’t know. We would like to see a capitulation trade, but the seasonals are starting to turn,” Brenner said. “The end of February to the middle of March is an awful time for equity seasonals.”

>It took just 16 trading sessions for US stocks to tumble into a correction, leaving a frazzled Wall Street asking just how long the “adjustment period” White House officials have warned about will last.

>In the prior 24 instances when stocks have fallen at least 10% from a record but avoided a bear market, it has taken an average of eight months to reclaim an all-time high, according to data from CFRA Research. That would leave the Feb. 19 high intact until mid-October. The average drawdown reached 14% in those cases.

>“Corrections are unnerving in the moment, though they are not unusual, and often act as a pressure release valve for overheated markets,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This will not be the last correction, pullback, or market scare that the bulls will have to face, and yes, an element of caution is warranted.”

>“We say this is a correction, not a bear market in US stocks,” Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett said. “Since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade and monetary policy.”

>Yet a century-old indicator that has helped predict the direction of the US stock market is signaling more pain ahead for battered investors.

>Known as the Dow Theory, it holds that moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average must be confirmed by transport stocks, and vice versa, to be sustained. As of Thursday’s close, the 20-member Dow Jones Transportation Average — a barometer of consumer and industrial demand — has slumped 19% from its November peak, teetering near so-called bear-market territory.

>“What usually differentiates quicker (often healthy) selloffs from drawn-out bear markets is whether a recession follows,” said Ross Mayfield at Baird Private Wealth Management.

>The 23 non-recession corrections since 1965 averaged a 16% drawdown, he said. Meantime, the 8 recession selloffs over that period averaged a 36% drawdown.

The feature will be offered as a part of an AirPods software upgrade later this year, the report said, and will be tied to the iOS 19 update to its mobile operating system.

Rival earbuds such as Google's Pixel Buds have had the option for years, the report said.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company had last year said its AirPods Pro 2 can be turned into a personalized hearing aid via software updates.

Apple is planning a major overhaul to its software later on this year and will change the look of its operating systems and interface of its iPhone, iPad and Mac, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

> 
> Under European Union rules, a number of funds badged as sustainable need to ensure their investments 'Do No Significant Harm'. Many have avoided the sector entirely, with even engine maker Rolls Royce (RR.L) and Airbus (AIR.PA), which has a big commercial aviation division, judged off limits.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/ram-owner-wants-to-bring-cheaper-pickup-back-to-us-cfo-says

Stellantis NV thinks there’s still demand for an affordable version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck in the US market after the stripped-down “Ram Classic” ceased production last year, Chief Financial Officer Doug Ostermann said.

“We need to introduce kind of a lower-end trim of the new pickup to fill that gap,” Ostermann said at a Wolfe Research conference on Tuesday, cautioning that it would not come to market “immediately.”

Dodge Ram is owned by Stellantis NV, a multinational automotive corporation formed on January 16, 2021, following the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group (Peugeot). This merger created Stellantis, which now oversees a vast portfolio of brands, including Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, and Peugeot.

In 2024, Stellantis faced significant challenges, including a sharp decline in U.S. sales, leading to a 16% drop despite overall market growth. 

This downturn was partly attributed to aggressive cost-cutting measures under CEO Carlos Tavares, such as reducing popular Jeep models, which some believed harmed long-term demand. These strategies led to internal disagreements, culminating in Tavares’s abrupt resignation in December 2024.  ￼ 

Additionally, labor tensions escalated when Stellantis filed a federal lawsuit against the United Auto Workers (UAW), alleging violations of their contract due to strike threats.  

In 2025, Stellantis unveiled plans to revitalize the Dodge brand lineup and detailed a strategy emphasizing increased marketing expenditures, competitive incentive programs, and the introduction of more affordable vehicle trims.",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,1717,False

Plus, their economies are pretty small, with only a few niche exports (mostly natural resources).

Rheinmetall's shares price could double to 3,000 euros by 2030 if European defense spending reaches 3% of gross domestic product, Morgan Stanley analysts Marie-Ange Riggio and Ross Law say. The German arms maker could potentially receive cumulative orders of between 325 billion euros and 450 billion euros by the end of this decade. Achieving this would force the group to double its manufacturing capacity starting in 2027, but that would be feasible, they add. The analysts estimate that Rheinmetall had a 12% share of the European equipment market in 2024, and an upward trend in market share is likely to continue as land platforms remain in focus in the near future. This could be confirmed by the European Commission's defense white paper, set to be published Wednesday.

1jem929,"Nvidia, GM announce deal for AI, factories and next-gen vehicles",83,17,Puginator,2025-03-18 21:55:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jem929/nvidia_gm_announce_deal_for_ai_factories_and/,0.91,False,False,False,"General Motors and Nvidia have agreed to a strategic collaboration that includes the automaker using several products and artificial intelligence services from the tech giant for its next-generation vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems and factories.

The companies on Tuesday announced that the new initiatives include building custom artificial intelligence systems using Nvidia compute platforms, including “Omniverse with Cosmos,” for optimizing GM’s factory planning and robotics.

The Detroit automaker also said it will use “Nvidia Drive AGX” for “in-vehicle hardware for future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin enhanced safety driving experiences.”

GM declined to disclose a cost for the new tools with Nvidia. The tech company has been attempting to diversify its automotive business, which has notably included substantial work in data centers and GPUs.

“The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we’re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they’re made,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia founder and CEO, said in a release. “We are thrilled to partner with GM to build AI systems tailored to their vision, craft and know-how.”

GM has been using Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, for training AI models across various areas of its business, including simulation and validation. The new business expands to in-vehicle hardware, automotive plant design and operations, the companies said.

The automaker also had been testing Nvidia’s Omniverse since at least 2022. Some of GM’s testing was in designing a “digital twin,” or replica, of its new design center and processes to assist virtual vehicle development. It also acted as a single digital environment for employees to work and collaborate in, according to a video last year featuring GM for Nvidia’s GTC developer conference in 2023.

Nvidia anticipated it would strike a deal with GM mid-last year for Omniverse, according to an internal company email viewed by CNBC. At that time, two sources with GM signaled the automaker wasn’t sure Nvidia’s software and GPUs were worth the high cost compared with other companies.

It wasn’t immediately clear what sealed the deal for GM. But since that time, both companies have experienced increased competition from China and uncertain regulatory changes such as tariffs. GM’s stock is off roughly 8% during in 2025, while Nvidia is off about 12% this year.

“AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in Nvidia’s release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.”

The companies announced the new initiatives in connection with Nvidia’s GTC AI conference this week in California.

Nvidia describes Omniverse as a platform for “developing and deploying physically based industrial digitalization applications.” It’s essentially connecting a physical environment with a digital, or software, world to optimize processes using a “digital twin” of a physical environment such as a GM design facility or plant.

Users of Nvidia’s Omniverse have included BMW, Amazon Robotics and Samsung, Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology, said during a media briefing a year ago. He said the company was licensing Omniverse for $4,500 per GPU, per year.

It’s unclear how many GPUs GM will need. But given the amount of robotics, sensors and other systems needed to operate a modern assembly plant, it would likely be quite a bit.

More than 20 other automakers have used Nvidia’s “system on a chip” hardware in the central computing units of their smart vehicles, including Mercedes Benz, Volvo, Audi, Volkswagen and BYD, according to an industry equity research note from Jeffries in November 2023.

In recent years, Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its GPUs, which are used for everything from bitcoin mining to AI inference and training.

1jfbxyd,SoftBank to acquire chip designer Ampere in $6.5 billion deal,54,8,Puginator,2025-03-19 20:08:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfbxyd/softbank_to_acquire_chip_designer_ampere_in_65/,0.88,False,False,False,"SoftBank Group said Wednesday that it will acquire Ampere Computing, a startup that designed an Arm-based server chip, for $6.5 billion. The company expects the deal to close in the second half of 2025, according to a statement.

Carlyle Group and Oracle both have committed to selling their stakes in Ampere, SoftBank said.

Ampere will operate as an independent subsidiary and will keep its headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the statement said.

“Ampere’s expertise in semiconductors and high-performance computing will help accelerate this vision, and deepens our commitment to AI innovation in the United States,” SoftBank Group Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son was quoted as saying in the statement.

The startup has 1,000 semiconductor engineers, SoftBank said in a separate statement.

Chips that use Arm’s instruction set represent an alternative to chips based on the x86 architecture, which Intel and AMD sell. Arm-based chips often consume less energy. Ampere’s founder and CEO, Renee James, established the startup in 2017 after 28 years at Intel, where she rose to the position of president.

Leading cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services offers Graviton Arm chip for rent that have become popular among large customers. In October, Microsoft started selling access to its own Cobalt 100 Arm-based cloud computing instances.

1jb8fno,"EU’s big Starlink headache is time, not money",55,32,Grigori_Rasputin1869,2025-03-14 12:47:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jb8fno/eus_big_starlink_headache_is_time_not_money/,0.86,False,False,False,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - As relations between Ukraine and the Trump administration sour, Kyiv has encountered a pressing problem: it relies on Starlink to help its military coordinate operations. The good news is that it wouldn’t break the bank to replace Elon Musk’s satellite operator with kit supplied by $3 billion Anglo-French rival Eutelsat (ETL.PA), opens new tab. The bad news is that executing such a switch would be highly complex – and couldn’t happen overnight.

As things stand it doesn’t look like Musk will imminently axe Ukraine’s Starlink access, which is part funded by Poland. He just wants the world to know there would be devastating consequences if he did. In a March 9 post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the billionaire claimed Ukraine’s “entire front line would collapse” without links to his satellites. Though he went on to insist he’d never pull the plug, such episodes underline the case for using a satellite operator based in the European Union.

At first glance, the costs of such a swap might appear to be a major barrier. Providing internet from space requires terminals on the ground to transmit satellite signals to end users, and analysts estimate the price of one Eutelsat ground terminal is around $10,000. Musk’s company, by comparison, offers terminals to Ukrainian consumers at less than $600 each. Assuming each of Starlink’s 40,000 or so terminals in Ukraine is eventually swapped out with a Eutelsat one, the replacement drive would cost $400 million before the internet is even switched on.

Weighed against the EU’s $17 trillion GDP this expense looks bearable, though. The European Commission is talking about mobilising 800 billion euros for defence, including 150 billion euros in loans for member states to spend on weapons. Throw in scope to raise pandemic-style joint debt at the EU level, and the bloc should be both able and willing to fund a satcom switch for Ukraine.

What’s less clear is whether Eutelsat’s OneWeb constellation has the satellite heft to deliver a quality of internet comparable to Musk’s outfit. Eutelsat has around 650 satellites in low earth orbit, far less than Starlink’s 7,000-strong fleet. Calculations by investment bank Bryan Garnier suggest the OneWeb constellation could only offer Ukraine one or two dozen gigabits of data per second (GBPS), a rate sufficient to supply around 10,000 residential ground terminals. Eutelsat has a powerful satellite in farther-flung geostationary orbit that could help to fill the gap, but whether the result is connectivity on par with Starlink’s is uncertain.

Capacity concerns aside, there are also questions around Eutelsat’s ability to roll out the new terminals on the ground at the necessary pace. The company’s CEO Eva Berneke told Bloomberg, opens new tab that the group would be capable of sourcing 40,000 of them in a matter of months. But unlike Starlink, which makes all its own equipment, Eutelsat relies on third parties to supply its terminals. These vary in terms of size and capabilities, with several bulky and power-hungry designs in the mix.

Even if Eutelsat can get its hands on the kit in a matter of months, there’s no guarantee that the mix of those terminals would meet the actual demands of Ukraine’s forces on the ground, according to Hamish Low of Enders Analysis. Matching terminals to the appropriate locations and users will take time.

One consolation is that Ukraine doesn’t necessarily need all of its Starlink capacity to fight a war with Russia. Some of the terminals in the country are used by civilians for day-to-day communications, while others support government institutions.

Another consolation is that Eutelsat may have some breathing space. The U.S. agreed on March 12 to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Compared with last month, when Trump administration negotiators reportedly raised the possibility of cutting off Starlink if a critical minerals deal failed to materialise, that arguably counts as a conciliatory turn.
At 6 euros, Eutelsat shares have risen fivefold in the two weeks since Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s infamous White House encounter with Trump. That’s still far below the 30 euros-plus at which they traded a decade ago, and the company still has around 2.5 billion euros of net debt. Either way investors seem confident that Eutelsat will be a winner in Europe’s rearmament – the question is how committed EU politicians are to ramping it up.

1je3mot,Games Workshop Stock: Is Warhammer worth more than Star Wars when acquired by Disney?,53,66,JCRUZ_z,2025-03-18 08:21:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1je3mot/games_workshop_stock_is_warhammer_worth_more_than/,0.73,False,False,False,"This post is in relation to Games Workshop (LON: GAW), the \~£4.66 billion (\~$5.93B USD) tabletop gaming titan behind Warhammer.

My thesis: Warhammer’s universe, intellectual property (IP) and ecosystem are worth *more* than GAW’s current market cap *and* what Disney paid for Star Wars in 2012 ($4.05B, or $5.54B in 2025 dollars).

I know this might sound bold. One can say that Warhammer’s a niche , not a mainstream beast like Star Wars was. However, as someone that's been closely monitoring latest developments of Warhammer in social media and considering an almost 50 years of lore, a rabid fanbase, and catalysts like Henry Cavill’s Amazon series, this could be a sleeper hit the market’s undervaluing.

Let’s break it down.

GAW is the king of tabletop wargaming, crafting Warhammer universes—*40k* (grimdark sci-fi), *Age of Sigmar* (fantasy), and *The Old World* (retro fantasy). Founded in 1975 by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone with *Owl and Weasel*—a newsletter that became *White Dwarf* in 1977—it’s been building lore for 50 years. Today, it’s a £145/share stock with:

* **Market Cap**: £4.66B ($5.93B).
* **Revenue (2024)**: £577.5M ($735M), up 15.6% CAGR over 5 years.
* **Margins**: 71% gross, 41% operating, 30% net—insanely efficient.
* **Cash**: £125.8M, net debt negative (-£79.4M).
* **P/E**: 27.1—pricey, but growth justifies it.

Warhammer’s niche: 1-2M players dropping $200-500/year on minis, paints, and books. It’s not Disney’s scale, but it’s a moat—high-margin, loyal, and sticky.

# The Thesis: Warhammer’s IP is worth more than $5.9B (and Star Wars’ 2012 Price). GAW’s $5.9B cap reflects a tabletop business, but Warhammer’s IP (its lore, brand, and potential) could fetch $9-10B if sold to a Disney/Amazon/Netflix. (*)

*\[\*Edit: I am just trying to* ***value*** *WH's IP and $GAW, not saying I want it to be sold or anything.\]*

Why?

It’s a 50-year universe with untapped multimedia juice, and it’s firing on all cylinders in 2025. Let’s compare:

* **Disney’s Star Wars Deal**: $4.05B in 2012 ($5.54B today) got Lucasfilm—six films, $4.4B box office, $20B in merchandise, 35 years of lore. Disney turned it into $12B+ by 2024.
* **Warhammer Today**: No films (yet), but $735M revenue, 50 years of history and a lore deeper than Star Wars—10,000 years of *40k*, Chaos Gods, Space Marines, plus *Old World* nostalgia. Licensing’s just $38M—5% of revenue—but it’s a powder keg.

**Valuation Math**:

* Core revenue ($735M) x 8 (media IP multiple) = $5.88B.
* Licensing upside ($500M/year from films/TV, Star Wars-scale) x 5 = $2.5B.
* 50-year brand premium = $1-2B.
* **Total**: $9-10B—above GAW’s cap and Star Wars’ 2012 price.

Crazy? Maybe. But Warhammer’s fans are deep into it. Warhammer’s got potential.

# Why Now? 2025 is lighting up:

1. **Warhammer 40k 10th Edition**:
   * Launched June 2023, drove 10.8% core revenue growth in 2024 ($490M). Half-year to Dec 2024: 16.4% up ($307.5M).
   * X buzz (Q1 2025): “warhammer"" traffic’s 12-15M/month, up 10-20% from Q4 2024.
   * Potential: $75M/year growth through 2026.
2. **Henry Cavill’s Amazon Series**:
   * Deal locked Dec 2024: Cavill stars/produces a *40k* cinematic universe.
   * Licensing ($38M now) could double to $76M by 2027, with $40M+ indirect sales if 200K newbies buy armies.
3. **The Old World Resurgence**:
   * Jan 2024 launch, new faction drops (and rumours regarding Cathay).
   * People +30 are getting back to Warhammer. Veterans spending $50-250/army per year
4. **Hachette’s Combat Patrol**:
   * Launched Sept 2024 (UK), Jan 2025 (Spain via Salvat). Weekly mag with minis hooks newbies.
   * Launched in US too.

# Warhammer vs. Star Wars?

Warhammer’s no Star Wars, yet. Star Wars had mass appeal; Warhammer’s a cult with 1-2M players. But:

* **Lore**: 50 years, denser than Star Wars’ 35 in 2012. *Black Library* churns 20+ novels/year—*Horus Heresy* alone is 60+ books.
* **Fanbase**: Smaller but fanatic—players co-create (painting, campaigns). Star Wars sold toys; Warhammer sells a lifestyle.
* **Upside**: Star Wars had films in the can; Warhammer’s a blank slate. Cavill’s series could be its *Force Awakens*.

Some say Warhammer's too niche. I say it has a potential future mass craze.

$9-10B is what a buyer pays for potential, not just today’s market cap.

* **Now**: £145, P/E 27, 4.2% dividend yield. Fair value: £150-160 (EPS $5.35 to $6).
* **Bull Case**: Revenue hits $850M by 2027 (Cavill, *Old World*), EPS $9, P/E 25 = £225—50% upside.
* **Buyout**: A $9B bid spins the IP to Amazon, triples licensing in 5 years.

Risks? Cavill flops, *Old World* fades—growth slows to 5%, stock stalls at £150. But GAW’s 67% ROIC and monopoly scream resilience IMO.

# Thank you in advance for your feedback on my comparison of Warhammer to Star Wars.

I’m planning on buying LEAPS to take advantage of what looks like an overreaction.

Pros:

✅ Strong revenue growth – Still growing 23% YoY, despite ad spending softness
✅ High margins – 84% gross margins, which is best-in-class for ad tech
✅ Solid balance sheet – $1.5B in cash and no debt, giving them flexibility
✅ CTV dominance – Continued leadership in connected TV (CTV) advertising

Cons:

❌ Near-term ad spend weakness – Advertisers are cutting budgets in a tough macro environment
❌ Competitive pressures – Google and Amazon are pushing harder into programmatic advertising
❌ High valuation (even after the drop) – Still trades at 15-16x forward sales, though historically it’s commanded a premium

The long-term growth story for TTD remains intact, even if Q1 guidance disappointed. The market has punished it heavily, but historically, high-quality growth stocks tend to bounce back once macro pressures ease.

1jfa3t2,Why Investing in Canadian Small-Caps Sucks – Naked Short Selling Explained,39,17,10baggerss,2025-03-19 18:44:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfa3t2/why_investing_in_canadian_smallcaps_sucks_naked/,0.76,False,False,False,"I’ve heard a ton about naked short selling over the years, and I kind of understood what it was, but I never really got why it’s such a big issue in Canada. After looking into it more, it’s pretty clear this is something anyone investing in Canadian small caps should at least be aware of.

Short selling itself isn’t the problem. That’s just when someone borrows shares, sells them, and buys them back cheaper to return to the lender. If they guess right and the stock drops, they make money. It’s a normal market function.

Naked short selling is a whole different story. Instead of borrowing shares before selling, traders just sell them without actually owning or locating them. These shares don’t exist, but the sale still goes through, creating artificial selling pressure.

The issue is that when too many of these phantom shares hit the market, it makes it look like there’s way more selling than there actually is. The price drops, not because investors are actually dumping shares, but because the market is reacting to fake supply.

This is brutal for small caps, especially junior miners in Canada. Big stocks have enough liquidity to absorb short selling, but small stocks don’t. If there’s even a little naked shorting, it can completely crush a stock that should be moving up on good news.

Some companies are fighting back. Power Nickel filed complaints with regulators in late 2023, showing data that millions of their shares had been sold but never delivered. You’d think regulators would be all over that, but apparently not. They barely responded, and nothing really came of it.

Then there’s Save Canadian Mining, an advocacy group led by Terry Lynch and backed by investors like Eric Sprott and Rob McEwen. They’ve been pushing for tougher enforcement, arguing that Canadian regulators have let this problem spiral out of control.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has actually started cracking down. In 2023, a legal change made brokers responsible for their clients’ illegal naked shorting. If a trader sells shares they don’t own and it causes damage to a company, the broker can now be held legally accountable. That forces brokers to actually pay attention instead of just looking the other way.

Canada hasn’t caught up. There’s been talk about changing the rules, but no real action. Companies keep getting hammered by what should be illegal short selling, and investors are left wondering why their stocks never move, even when the fundamentals look solid.

So where does this go from here? In the U.S., lawsuits against brokers are picking up, and firms are being forced to take this issue more seriously. In Canada, it’s still business as usual. Either regulators start enforcing the rules properly, or companies are going to have to take matters into their own hands.

Curious to hear what others think. Have you seen this play out in any stocks you follow? Do you think regulators will actually do anything, or is this just how things are always going to be?",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,2979,False

Let's say a user promotes a false rumor about Taylor Swift--for example that part of her song writing process is getting in the zone by abusing pregnant, disabled puppies. As a post the only person with legal vulnerability is the user, even if the moderator/site passively fails to remove it.

On the other hand, let's say other users who see this false rumor and aim to disprove it are disciplined by the moderators (who share the first users hate of Taylor Swift)--for instance, issuing bans to users who challenge the original user or present contradictory information. At that point the role of RDDT and its moderators is no longer passive but is taking active steps to promote a false rumor against Ms. Swift. That moderator becomes legally liable in the same way as the original poster was.

(Note: This stuff really happens....)

Finally, if RDDT is negligent in preventing moderators from actively promoting false narratives (whether in a specific instance or not taking due care to prevent this occurrence, for instance via more robust site wide policies) RDDT also assumes liability.

Does this affect the longterm outlook for investors in RDDT?",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,2026,False

The CME fedwatch survey shows market expects Fed to do 2-3 rate cuts this year.

But in my view, with the present uncertainty with fast changing tariff rules and DOGE based cuts, the Fed cannot model it's affect on the inflation and unemployment.  
Without a working model and predictions, ***Fed cannot realistically cut rates***.

The best they can do is hold rates and wait for some clarity on how much tariffs will be applied into this year and next. And then decide on whether to cut or raise rates. The affect of tariff will take time to show up in the economy and there is still time for Fed to act.

And if Fed acts early and say makes a rate cut , and 2 months later we end-up with high inflation, it will make things a lot worse and raising rates will panic the market.

Additionally the deportation hasn't picked up and it will also affect the economy in unknown ways. Deportation can cut unemployment and raise inflation, which would force Fed to maintain rates or in worse case raise them.

The Fed rate cut expectations from traders/investors, is more out of desperation hoping that cut will boost the market. It will be very dangerous to act early and Fed having seen the inflation past 2 years will be cautious.

I expect Powell to not commit to any rate cut, instead sweet talk saying we are watching closely and in case of any risk of recession, high unemployment or liquidity crisis, we will act aggressively. But right now we are waiting to see how the tariff affects unfolds and we will follow the data.  
In short talk encouraging but not commit to any rate cut.

Am interested in your views ( to make sure I am not thinking wrong or crazy.)

Apple Inc.’s top executive overseeing its Siri virtual assistant told staff that delays to key features have been ugly and embarrassing, and a decision to publicly promote the technology before it was ready made matters worse.

Robby Walker, who serves as a senior director at Apple, delivered the stark comments during an all-hands meeting for the Siri division, saying that the team was facing a bad period. Walker also said that it’s unclear when the enhancements will actually launch, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the gathering was private.

The frank discussion shows the extent of Apple’s crisis in the field of artificial intelligence, where it’s struggling to catch up with peers. Siri — less advanced than rival systems — has become a symbol of Apple’s AI challenges. And the company’s woes boiled over last week, when it acknowledged publicly that critical features would be delayed indefinitely. 

During the all-hands gathering, Walker suggested that employees on his team may be feeling angry, disappointed, burned out and embarrassed after the features were postponed. The company had been racing to get the technology ready for this spring, but now the features aren’t expected until next year at the earliest, people familiar with the matter have said. 

Still, he praised the team for developing “incredibly impressive” features and vowed to deliver an industry-leading virtual assistant to consumers. 

On Feb. 14, Bloomberg News reported that Apple was struggling with bugs and engineering problems on its planned artificial intelligence tools for Siri. At the time, the company postponed the release from April to May, aiming to include the features in its iOS 18.5 operating system. Now it’s looking to add them as an update as early as the iOS 19 software cycle next year.

The features — unveiled last June at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference — are fundamental to making Siri a more effective personal assistant. The technology will allow the software to tap into users’ personal data to better respond to queries. It also will let Siri more precisely control apps and analyze content that’s on a user’s screen.

But when Apple demonstrated the features at WWDC using a video mock-up, it only had a barely working prototype, Bloomberg has reported. Walker told staff in the meeting that the delays were especially “ugly” because Apple had already showed off the features publicly. “This was not one of these situations where we get to show people our plan after it’s done,” he said. “We showed people before.”

“To make matters worse,” Walker said, Apple’s marketing communications department wanted to promote the enhancements. Despite not being ready, the capabilities were included in a series of marketing campaigns and TV commercials starting last year.

Apple touted the features as a key selling point of the iPhone 16 line, which otherwise lacked major changes. And it’s part of a broader AI push called Apple Intelligence.

Walker also raised doubts about even meeting the current release expectations. Though Apple is aiming for iOS 19, it “doesn’t mean that we’re shipping then,” Walker said. The company has several more priorities in development, and trade-offs will need to be made, he said.

“We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,” Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. “We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.” He said decisions on timing will be made on a “case-by-case basis” as work progresses on products planned for next year.

“Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,” he said. “We’re going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.”

Walker said that there is “intense personal accountability” about this effort shared by his boss John Giannandrea, the head of AI at Apple, as well as software chief Craig Federighi and other executives.

As of Friday, Apple doesn’t plan to immediately fire any top executives over the AI crisis, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That decision could theoretically change at any time. In any case, the company is poised to make management adjustments. It has discussed moving more senior executives under Giannandrea to assist with a turnaround effort. Already, the company tapped longtime executive Kim Vorrath — seen as a project fixer — to assist the group.

Walker said the decision to delay the features was made because of quality issues and that the company has found the technology only works properly up to two-thirds to 80% of the time. He said the group “can make more progress to get those percentages up, so that users get something they can really count on.”

In recent weeks, Federighi voiced concerns to other senior executives that the features weren’t working as advertised, ultimately prompting the decision to delay, Bloomberg reported. Issues with Apple Intelligence were clear from the start, with the company postponing the first batch of features last year and providing vague timelines during its launch event.

Walker defended his Siri group, telling them that they should be proud. Employees poured their “hearts and souls into this thing,” he said. “I saw so many people giving everything they had in order to make this happen and to make incredible progress together.”

But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they’re polished, he said. “These are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.”

He showed examples during the meeting of the technology working: It was able to locate his driver’s license number on command and find specific photos of a child. He also demonstrated how the technology could precisely manipulate apps via voice control. It embedded content in an email, added recipients and made other changes.

Walker told staff that they should “feel really proud of innovative work” done to develop the personal search feature, despite saying it doesn’t always work sufficiently.

Still, the company has met other goals for Siri. That includes bringing a Type-to-Siri interface to iOS 18, as well as adding Apple product knowledge to the platform and an improved understanding of customers. It’s planning to offer Apple Intelligence in several new languages next month and is working overtime to enable the features for China as part of partnerships with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc.

The executive said he didn’t want things to get worse before they got better, saying that special attention will need to be paid to the integration of existing features into iOS 19.

But there’s still a long road ahead. The delayed Siri features are just the first step toward modernizing the software. Apple has been planning upgrades for 2027 that will make Siri more conversational, letting it better compete with other AI chatbots, Bloomberg has reported.",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,7229,False

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I was wondering how long most of you hold your stocks. Do you buy them mostly after speculation that they will go up, and hold them for a few days to weeks or months trying to time the market? Or perhaps you try to find stocks with strong growth catalysts like consistent year over year EPS or ROE, combined with the a few year time horizon on the company’s business activities.

Or do you look at it very long term, trying to find undervalued stocks that you believe the market will eventually the potential of? Whether months, years or decades, you try to find stocks that you believe the market will eventually value correctly.

**Top Lessons:**
- Value investing centers on acquiring ownership in businesses by assessing their true worth, rather than trading stocks based on market momentum.
- The research-driven process requires investors to methodically analyze financial data and business operations, setting aside emotional biases or snap judgments to determine a company's long-term potential.
- Value investors emphasize a company's core fundamentals— such as consistent cash flows, tangible assets, and reliable earnings-over transient market price swings. By anchoring their focus on these measurable attributes, they avoid being swayed by speculative trends or short-lived volatility in stock valuations.
- The practice of value investing involves calculating a company's intrinsic economic value, derived from its financial statements and operational performance, which remains steadier than its market price. This disciplined valuation approach allows investors to pinpoint opportunities where the stock price diverges significantly from the business's underlying worth.
- Patience and discipline are essential in value investing, as stocks bought at a discount to their intrinsic value often need months or years to reach their fair market price. Investors must commit to holding these positions, trusting that over time, the market will adjust to reflect the company's fundamental strengths.
- Value investors target stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios, typically indicating that a company's market price undervalues its earnings capacity relative to peers. Rather than chasing popular or overhyped stocks, they seek out these underappreciated opportunities, which statistical evidence suggests offer a greater margin of safety and return potential.
- Evaluating a company's competitive advantages—such as cost efficiencies from scale, strong customer loyalty, or patented technologies—is a key step in identifying businesses with durable profitability. These advantages, quantifiable through market share data or profit margins, signal a company's ability to maintain its economic edge and deliver sustained value to shareholders.

Verve Group is a digital media firm that uses AI-driven solutions to optimize advertising by connecting advertisers with publishers. Led by CEO Remco Westermann. What is remarkable is that Remco owns almost 25% of the company.

Verve’s Q4 2024 was strong, with 24% organic growth and full-year revenue reaching €437m, exceeding forecasts.

Many analysts have given a buy recommendation to this, while target price is something between 50-60$.

Price: ~$184

Restaurants Owned: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Chuy's, Seasons 52, Eddie V's, and Bahama Breeze

My Postions:
5x 1/16/26 $185 puts
5x 1/16/26 $170 puts

Bear Case: 

With the current economic instability and uncertainty, many stocks from all industries have seen sharp decreases in value. For the case of this write up, I will mostly be focused on hotel, restaurant, and airline industries, since these industries are closely correlated and are considered elastic goods. Moreover, tourism to the United States, which is a key revenue source for these industries, will likely be down going forward due to rises in foreign tensions. Many Canadians are already talking about cancelling and boycotting travel to the United States, so these industries will feel the repercussions in the following months/years.

Airlines: 
Delta: -30% in the past month
United Airlines: -28% in the past month
American Airlines: -30% in the past month

Restaurants/Food:
Sbux: -12.7% in the past month
Cava: -37% in the past month
Wingstop: -30% in the past month
Chipotle: -14% in the past month

Hotels:
Hyatt: -15.33% in the past month
Mariott: -15.4% in the past month
Hilton: -15.26% in the past month

$DRI has not yet taken a hit from the recent economic turmoil, only dropping 5% in the past month. Due to the target audience of its restaurants, I believe that they are more susceptible to the affects of a recession than fast food restaurants such as Wingstop, Chipotle, and Cava, which have seen significant dips recently. 

Restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse are treated as a night out for lower class/lower middle class Americans, and will be among the first expenses to be cut when budgets inevitably tighten. I believe in the case of a recession, more Americans will ditch restaurants like Olive Garden and Longhorse steakhouse than Chipotle, Wingstop, and Cava.

For reference here is how $DRI performed during the past recessions/pullbacks

2008: -68.5% decrease
2020: -63% decrease
2022: -25% decrease

I believe $DRI has much room to fall over the next year and maybe even longer.

We are profoundly saddened to share that a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has passed away following treatment with ELEVIDYS, having suffered acute liver failure. Acute liver injury is a known possible side effect of ELEVIDYS and other AAV-mediated gene therapies and is highlighted in the prescribing information. Although it is not a new safety signal and the benefit-risk of ELEVIDYS remains positive, acute liver failure (ALF) leading to death represents a severity of acute liver injury not previously reported for ELEVIDYS, which to date has been used to treat more than 800 patients in clinical trials or as a prescribed therapy.

>In addition, testing revealed this patient had a recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection which was identified by the treating physician as a possible contributing factor. CMV can infect and damage the liver, a condition known as CMV hepatitis.

>Patient safety and well-being are Sarepta’s top priority. We continue to gather and analyze the information from this event. The event has been reported to the relevant health authorities and Sarepta intends to update the prescribing information to appropriately represent this event. We have also reported the event to ELEVIDYS clinical study investigators and prescribing physicians.

1jdtac9,Austal Shares Jump After Hanwha Acquires Stake in Shipbuilder,5,0,s1n0d3utscht3k,2025-03-17 21:10:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jdtac9/austal_shares_jump_after_hanwha_acquires_stake_in/,0.66,False,False,False,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/austal-shares-jump-after-hanwha-acquires-stake-in-shipbuilder

Shares of Australian shipbuilder Austal Ltd. climbed after a unit of Hanwha Aerospace Co. became a substantial shareholder in the company, as the Korean defense firm aims to bolster its reach.

Austal’s stock rose as much as 9.7% in Sydney trading on Tuesday, its largest jump since Feb. 21, after a subsidiary of Hanwha acquired a 9.9% stake in the firm. The Korean company also applied to the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board to increase its holding to 19.9%, it said in a statement.

Hanwha purchased 41.2 million Austal shares at A$4.45 per share, according to an exchange statement, a 16% premium from Monday’s close.

The move is part of an effort by the Asian defense giant to expand its presence in the region, with the sector receiving renewed interest from investors amid expectations of revenue boosts from increased military expenditure globally. Hanwha Aerospace’s stock has more than doubled this year and is one of the top gainers on Asia’s equity benchmark.

Hanwha unsuccessfully attempted to buy the Australian company last year. In April, the Korean firm said no further discussions were underway, though it was working to continue talks with Austal’s management and board on its acquisition proposal.

Gold prices have surged to a record high, surpassing $3,000 per ounce for the first time, driven by trade tensions/uncertainty. This is somewhat similar to my VXX/VIX play from a few days ago, essentially a short volatility trade. Again, still short VXX because I think we've peaked (for now) in terms of volatility. VXX makes bigger moves in vol trades compared to gold so I prefer it for vol shorts.  The rise in gold prices shows how it still remains the hedge over the Coin, which essentially trades in-line with the market because it's still speculative. Overall trade tensions die down, Trump announces tariffs are over, the typical tariff business.

Overall a hell of a bounce (and earnings for the stock), not too interested in going long after the earnings announcement but if we spike up I'm interested in fading the move.

Peloton is at the turning point in its journey where there is meaningful upside potential from current levels."" I think this catalyst is dumb and I usually don't think about price target calls (like with Reddit earlier this week) but this HAS moved the stock.

The connected fitness industry is undergoing a transformation, with companies focusing on subscription-based models to drive recurring revenue.

I’ve read a few books on stock options trading when I considered doing it (not considering anymore) and it always surprised me why people would do it because it seems way more risky, and more importantly, much much more difficult. In stock options you often have to deal with not just the risk of the stock’s price move, but also implied volatility, time decay and delta. And on top of that, you risk losing the entire premium paid for the option if the stock’s price doesn’t go over/under your strike price, and these premiums can get very expensive if you lose a couple of bets in a row.

Obviously there’s multiple different ways you could combine these options to lower or amplify your risk, but to me that just gives more points of risk/failure of losing your investment if you don’t consider and do the proper DD.

This is not to say people shouldn’t trade options, I’m just not smart enough to trade them profitably. But for those of you who do trade options, how profitable has it been for you and how much more difficult is it than simply trading stock equity (and is the increased difficulty worth it?).",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,1277,False

Here’s a breakdown of how the company has evolved since COVID and what challenges/opportunities lie ahead.

# Pre-COVID (2016-2019): Strong Growth, but Slowing Momentum

* Looking at the 2016-2019 period the company had grown tremendously its store base getting to over 1,000 stores in the US, a doubling of footprint in five years. As a result, comparable sales (sales made only in stores already opened the previous years) were starting to normalize as incremental stores were generating less footfall and the ramp-up of opened stores was getting close to their optimal productivity. Ulta was on the way to maturing gracefully.

# COVID Bust & Boom: The Unexpected Turn

* COVID-19 triggered a wave of “boom and bust” scenarios across various industries. Companies like ZoomInfo and Domino's Pizza experienced significant sales increases during the pandemic, only to face normalization as the lock-downs ended. In contrast, Ulta went through the opposite trend: a bust followed by a boom, alongside sectors like hotels and spirits. Initially, the pandemic posed an existential threat to retailers like Ulta when no one could shop in stops anymore. However, as consumers found themselves with extra disposable income and a higher focus on self-care, Ulta capitalized on this shift, including through their relaunched e-commerce platform, leading to a remarkable rebound in comparable sales that surpassed pre-COVID levels.

# Normalization & The Sephora@Kohl’s Threat

* Under normal circumstances, we would have expected comparable sales to come down with a few weak quarters and then return to mid-to-high-single-digit industry growth post-COVID. However, in 2021, Sephora, the high-end beauty retailer owned by LVMH, launched an aggressive expansion by opening stores within Kohl’s stores, similar to Ulta's partnership with Target. Historically, Sephora had limited U.S. locations, primarily in city centers and airports. By leveraging Kohl’s locations, they targeted the same customer base as Ulta, attracting shoppers drawn to Sephora's ""prestige"" image despite an overall very similar product offering. Over the course of 3 years, Sephora opened 1,000 stores which are generating USD 1.8bn of revenue in 2024. Ulta admitted that 90% of their own stores had been impacted by new competitors' openings and that they had lost market shares.n.

# So, Is Ulta a Buy?

✅ **Positives:**

* Ulta has an impressive history of growth, disciplined capital allocation, generous returns to shareholders and very little debt (0.7x ND/EBITDA 2024). They are participating in one of my favorite categories: Beauty, which has a track record of sustainably growing mid single digit p.a. globally (see bonus chart at the end) and they have a strong brand, impressive loyalty program, and great store locations.

❌ **Concerns:**

* On the other hand, it is an asset-heavy business with limited scalability once stores reach optimum productivity, challenges in the online channel, and no significant international growth to date (Mexico is not yet live). They are being challenged by a very strong franchise with Sephora@Kohl’s, backed by deep-pocketed LVMH. In online they also face Amazon developing brand shops in prestige beauty with Estée Lauder.

# Valuation & Takeaway

* If consensus estimates hold with growth over +4% p.a. N3Y and end EBIT margin at 12.2%, with multiple remaining at 16x P/E NTM returns would be well in excess of 10% p.a. However, if growth remains weak on the back of Sephora (still targeting +11% growth in 2025 according to Kohl's reporting) and margins fail to expand beyond 12%, then its goes down.

1jbrhrp,The situation around European Defense Stocks,3,63,MisterTrader13,2025-03-15 05:36:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jbrhrp/the_situation_around_european_defense_stocks/,0.53,False,False,False,"I’m currently invested in American Defense Stocks (mostly Palantir) and a bunch of different European Defense Stocks. I got in a little late and only invested a few days ago.

I do believe the rally is not over yet. So far, I agree that it’s been pure speculation and Europe still has to pay up. However, I think we’re seeing a major cultural shift in Europe around defense. Trump said that if the EU doesn’t pay up, the US will completely remove all military funding to them. This obviously means Europe will have to pay to a certain extent. The question is, how much are they willing to pay up?

Let’s look at the situation right now. Ukraine is not done fighting yet and even if the US tries to help them get a ceasefire, so far the ceasefires conditions have not been accepted by Ukraine. Russia knows that the US under Trump will try to help negotiate more favourable conditions for them, which Ukraine will never agree to. So right now I don’t think the war is over yet. So that’ll definitely be more immediate spending by Europe on defense companies.

Even if we do somehow get a ceasefire within the next couple of weeks, the global environment has changed significantly. America does not want to send as much money overseas as it used to, and is moving more towards its original isolationist policies that were around before WW2. As china continues to scale up its military, it will continue to empower Russia to use as a buffer against the United States, and also get more favourable trades from them (oil, minerals etc.)

So without America, Europe will have to rely on itself. I don’t know how much Europe will be willing to spend on its military, but they are smart enough to know that the past 2 world wars happened on European soil and if they do not want a repeat of that, they can’t rely on anybody but themselves. No UN charter or rules or international law can save them when a countries more militarily armed than them decide to ignore the rules. 


So right now I’m just wondering how much do you guys think the EU will be willing to spend, at least over the next 4 years. How much of their budget do you think will be increased towards military spending. I know they’ve already increased it, but how much further are they willing to spend. 


Most people say Europe won’t spend much because of its culture around war. But keep in mind that that culture has only developed in the last 70 years. Before that Europe was a bloody place that had been fighting with each other for centuries. They know that if another war happens, even if it involves new powers from Asia, the European continent will not be spared. Another war or even the thought of it may actually break Europe. They spent the better part of the last century changing their culture around racial integration and rebuilding their economy from the rubbles. That culture was made for the sole purpose to avoid another war from ever happening. We like to think of the UN, WTO, WHO and all these international councils as to bring the world together, but their original purpose was to have better mutual cooperation and understanding in the west to prevent another war. 

Europe did everything except improve their military. I’d assume that was to prevent empowering threats from within Europe. Now that threats are coming out of Europe, they may have to start re-thinking their global outlook and strategy.

So these European Defense stock rallies could be the beginning of massive gains in the coming months and years.

I'm not putting down Apple's products - the iPhone did change the world, and Siri ...... well, at least the way we interact with our phones. But today, we're talking about stocks, and AAPL is looking more and more like a “shareholder-funded AI experiment”.



Apple's growth is slowing, iPhone sales are weak, and the company's attempts to boost demand with AI features like Apple Intelligence have frequently skipped a beat, with Siri's AI upgrade pushed back to 2026 or possibly even later, and iOS 18's bugs making the user experience even worse. Meanwhile, rivals like Google and Amazon have made significant strides in the AI assistant space.



To make matters worse, Apple's valuation is already ridiculously high, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29x, well above the S&P 500's 20x. That's clearly unsustainable given its single-digit growth expectations. The irony is that Cook seems to be focusing more on growth in the services business, while innovation in the iPhone as a core product has been weak. So why exactly is this company still worth so much money? How do you see Apple's future? Is it time to reassess its valuation?

I bought some SPY shares on 09/2024 and again on 12/2024, 1/2025, 2/2025, and 3/2025. All the shares bought since 12/2024 are bought within 30 days of each other.

Obviously, all the shares that I bought since 12/2024 are now in the red. I have some capital gains by selling other shares and would like to tax harvest these SPY shares.

If I sell all the SPY shares that I bought since 12/2024 and realize a loss of around 20k, (I can buy VTI right away). Would this trigger a wash sale?

It seems like I am clear for the 30days look back (since I didn't buy any SPY between 09/2024 and 12/2024) and I am not buying SPY or anything similar 30 days from now, I should be in the clear. However because I made many purchases between 12/2024 and 03/2025 (but I sell all those shares), I am not sure how the tax law treats these purchases.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/goldman-s-rubner-sees-correction-in-us-stocks-amid-weaker-flows](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/goldman-s-rubner-sees-correction-in-us-stocks-amid-weaker-flows)

The US stock market can flip into a correction territory as retail and institutional buyers are running out of steam, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Scott Rubner, the bank’s managing director for global markets and tactical specialist.

“The flow dynamics change dramatically starting Monday and I am on correction watch,” Rubner wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

US stocks hit a new record high on Wednesday despite uncertainty around tariffs and the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate path. Strong gains have been driven by resilient corporate earnings and strong flows from retail and institutional investors. But these dynamics could change starting from Monday, Rubner wrote.

Demand from retail traders, which have been piling into US stocks at a record pace this year, is expected to slow down ahead of the tax paying season in March. Flows from pension funds can also “run out of juice,” according to Rubner attributing it to seasonal trends. January and February are typically the strongest months of the year for yearly asset allocations, followed by weaker inflows in March.

Positioning across trend-following systematic funds also looks bearish. Commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, which buy or sell stocks depending on the market direction, are estimated to sell about $61 billion in US stocks over the next month should markets go lower, compared to only about $10 billion of buying in a bullish scenario.

On top of that, options market positioning also points to some volatility. According to Goldman’s estimates, dealers are currently long $9.8 billion of S&P 500 gamma, which acts as a market buffer when dealers are buying the dip. However, the bank’s index trading team estimates that 50% of this long gamma position rolls off Friday, and the market will have the ability to move more freely next week.

First of all I want to let you guys know my interest and knowledge in trading is very limited, so this could be a ‘stupid’ question, but hete we go:

i’ve been investing since august 2023 and put in around €250 monthly into the iShares MSCI World UCITS ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, in May and December input in about €400 due to my work bonus (not on top of the 250) My portfolio is currently at around €6,300, but it was obviously a lot more a few weeks ago, which has me questioning my approach. I don’t want to panic sell, but this just feels different.

Initially, I was confident about a long-term (10+ years) strategy, but now at 28, I’m feeling a bit uneasy given the current market situation. While I understand that stocks are “cheaper” now, I can’t shake the feeling that the market won’t recover anytime soon or could even get worse.

Would it be better to invest a little less and save more, since I don’t have a ton of savings, though I won’t really need the money now, savings aren’t that high. Would it be better to invest a little less and save more? Sell some and diversify? If so, what would be good diversification options? Or even any other advice?

For context: I’m not an active trader, just someone who invests every payday and tries not to check too often. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,1343,False

March 21, 2025, is a significant date in financial markets, as it is the third Friday of March. Traditionally, options and futures contracts usually have their expiration dates on the third Friday of each month.

With global sports viewership on the rise, I see them enjoying several more years of double-digit growth. Plus, as they scale, their margins are set to expand. Their free cash flow generation doubled in 2024, and they’re expecting an even better conversion rate in 2025.

Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,3334,False

""Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. However, only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/) pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the [Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

Why? Let’s break it down:

Market selloffs act as a cleansing mechanism, forcing weak hands and overleveraged traders to liquidate. As panic peaks—what traders call capitulation—patient, strategic investors step in to seize discounted opportunities.

Right now, we’re in one of those moments, just as a massive Fed meeting kicks off this upcoming Wednesday. The market has been in a three-week freefall. Part of that is now being shown to be attributed to over leveraged hedge funds getting wiped out in crowded positions. 
Could their timing be any worse? I’ve never seen hedge funds (and CTAs apparently) get steam rolled like that! 

I thought they were the smart money? All the while, the following items just happened: 

✅ The largest spending bill in U.S. history was just announced.
✅ Inflation is finally stabilizing.
✅ Interest rates are near 52-week lows.
✅ Deregulation is sweeping through multiple industries reducing legal costs and overhead 
✅ Tax cuts are now on their way to being passed including no tax on tips, no tax on over time, etc etc

1jc0zhg,Why $RDDT Is A Must Have Stock,0,43,Sad_Chest1484,2025-03-15 13:58:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jc0zhg/why_rddt_is_a_must_have_stock/,0.41,False,False,False,"Reddit is one of the premier social media apps out there with a cheap valuation (never judge a growth stock by P/E) for its growth trajectory.

Let's start with the fundamentals:

1. 2024 YE it had a 90.5% gross profit percentage, revenue grew by 62% (NVIDIA like growth??) and it became FCF positive. Next quarter revenue will be growing at 50% to ultimately end at 40% YoY based on guidance. I've been following $RDDT for quite some time and there is always a beat on revenue AND guidance versus what they expected so you can say there is a little bit of conservatism in this numbers.
2. From a balance sheet perspective it only has $26.7mm of debt. This company generated $215mm in FCF this year and is forecast to double to $520mm by next year. Capex spend is only 2% of its revenue. This companies management loves to run things efficiently and as cheaply as possible. On going concern is not an issue.
3. The company is already EPS positive and will turn EPS positive on a YoY basis by 2025 YE. If you look at it from a PEG perspective, it is trading at 0.74 for 2026. Anything below 1 is cheap. The only reason you see negative EPS is because the company has been expensing stock based compensation (US GAAP) requirement each quarter. This has ended in 2024, that is why you see major acceleration in EPS growth QoQ moving forward.
4. Share dilution is very minimal. A lot of growth companies like to pay employees in stock to attract talent, but that is not what reddit does. Diluated shares outstanding actually fell 1% in QoQ. This is great for any share holder.
5. Reddit data is a gold mine. Google pays Reddit $66mm a year for data licensing. This has 85% operating margin - so you need to remember Reddits profitability isn't going away anytime soon because you are starting from a high point.
6. Insider trading has popped up this weekend after the crazy drop. That is a significant buy signal.
7. From a multiple standpoint, price to sales, revenue etc it has gotten cheaper despite the stock increasing in value. Reddit user growth has exploded over time, with 50% international base and is becoming a hit globally. Reddit's top 15 advertisers spent 50% more YoY and international ad revenue grew by 77%.

\- THIS IS IMPORTANT. If US were to go slow down, the international piece provides a buffer on revenue for the company.

8) Advertising approach is incredibly unique. Reddit offers companies the ability to have AMAs to offer product information. I've personally seen this in my time using this reddit. Each subreddit is highly specialized which makes advertising that much easier. People pay Meta and Google top dollar because they are able to use statistical AI inference to generate ad campaigns well. Reddit doesn't need that. If you sell bikes, there's a laundry list of bike subreddits you can target. This is the future as Ad targeting improves on Reddit.

Downside / Bear bases:

1. Highly dependent on Google search. Google search was the reason that Reddit fell after earnings because of the average daily user count fell. Management has said this happens often in its existence and they worked quickly to get back on top of user searches. Management was largely dismissive of this because of their experience and noted higher levels of people asking questions and typing reddit at the end into google.
2. AI Capex slows down. This will erode profitability on the company, but given how ""clean"" reddit data is, this is the least of my concerns.
3. Execution and ad platform growth. Growing is expensive, and if Reddit adopts a spend what you can to get it done it will have investors fearful. Based on their CFO's commentary this is not very likely because how they approach things and history shows.
4. User growth slows down. This is highly possible, but I do believe the international side of things will be a buffer on user growth.

Having said all of this, my PT is $250 for the company. This is an absolute long term hold.

Any dips should be bought and even though Reddit looks expensive at face value, it really isn't. It trades at 50x forward earnings with 50% YoY growth and a net profitability that will approach 30+%. People are paying almost triple for Palantir and other software stocks out there.",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,4243,False

You will read so many reddit comments that reflect their anger and disbelief that the market is suddenly ignoring tariff tweets— the market has now priced much of it in and market will believe that the uncertainty is largely over before April 2.

Remember COVID, the bottom was in around March 20. And redditors could not believe it even past April!!

So many redditors think the bottom will not occur until AFTER april 2 and they are wrong. Market is forward looking and will have discounted tariffs before then.

Many redditors will FOMO back in next month or in May/June—they will lock in their previous losses —-just in time for the market to tank even harder! probably in Q3 when a real recession is here, and they panic again.

Just keep in mind the contrarian bearish AAII readings for 3 weeks in a row (it was as bad as 2009 GFC, it signaled a bottom in 2009) and SP500 Rsi at 30 and positive seasonality kicking in next week and positive vanna/charm March opex - all culminate into a rally of disbelief coming to destroy redditors’ sanity. 

Some data below:

INVESTOR SENTIMENT
AAII Bull/Bear Sentiment survey shows bearish sentiment at 60%, the highest level since recording 70% during 2008 financial crisis - reading this extreme show that 12 month later gains of 13.6%. This is the first time that bullish sentiment has been below 20% for three straight weeks. Bullish sentiment was last lower on September 22, 2022 (17.7%). 

Yesterday’s rally was a 90% upside breadth day. The last 90% day was 8/8/2024 - three days after the 8/5/2024 correction low.

VIX plunged 11% to 21 yesterday.

This was the 5th fastest correction in history. ALL previous rapid corrections found $SPX higher 3, 6, and 12 months forward.

Funny that all war machines companies don’t get the scrutiny and those companies sold stuffs to anyone especially on both sides sometime. US is a war driven country, I think everyone could understands that, even in Democratic Obama / Biden era. 

I am waiting TSLA to tank more and buy TSLQ and wait for it to transform.

everyone saying ""what should I do""?  lol the answer is nothing.  do nothing.  stay discipled and keep buying what you were buying.  if you can, buy a little more.  everyone always overreacts but that overreaction creates opportunities for the rest of us.

we had 45% gains the past 2 years and are only at 8% correction.  2% gains Friday and market is green today.  sp500 is 5600.  will all this matter in 2065 when the sp500 is 20,000+.  will it matter that you bought at 5600, 5000, 6000 or 7000?  cpi and other market numbers have come back good.

when you buy stocks, you are buying a piece of that company.  make sure it's a company you love and stay with it for 20 years.  where's the panic in that?",stocks,2025-03-20 09:54:23.350409,829,False
1jek6fx,Why Tesla deserves a look and probably a Buy at these Levels,0,105,rifleman209,2025-03-18 20:12:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jek6fx/why_tesla_deserves_a_look_and_probably_a_buy_at/,0.13,False,False,False,"We know the story, Elon’s right leanings are causing his core customers to revolt.

This has killed sentiment dropping the stock to uncanny low levels.

A few assumptions:

1. Analysts expect Revenue 3 years out are expected to be 200 billion. 

2. Tesla has had a P/S multiple between 6 and 28 historically

I built a matrix pricing Tesla between 6 to 10x sales and looked at sales of 150,180,200,210,225 (-25%,-10%,base,5%,12.5%) on that revenue estimate

This yields a market cap of 900 to 2,250 or a 3 year return ranging between 7.47% and 45.86% per year! They have also had minimal dilution in recent years.

I know I know, Elon is doing irreparable harm to the Tesla brand! It’s just like chipotle with ecoli, VW cheated on emissions, Equifax leaking all our data, Wells Fargo opening accounts and so on. 

DOGE is set to terminate in July of 2026 starting the distancing from Trump

For better or worse, fair or unfair, Tesla likely has a regulatory advantage in getting FSD approved thanks to Elon’s position. 

Overtime I expect Tesla will be valued like Apple, not legacy auto. Why? Well for one, Tesla doesn’t have a banking arm so that makes it far different than legacy auto for comparisons. Apple has lumpy iPhone sales followed by big fat juicy service revenue. Tesla, at maturity has the same potential. Lumpy car sales with subscriptions to FSD, Insurance, App Store, robo-taxi, repairs and maintenance, etc. this is the reason I used 6-10x sales above. These are around the multiple Apple has been valued at in recent years.

Additionally, the following is True:

They sell cars at retail prices to consumers whereas legacy auto sells cars wholesale to dealers.

They are one of the few to make EVs profitable at scale and have been wise to lower prices to levels legacy auto can’t compete at.

Tesla has many call options on its business with robotics and FSD

Never mix politics and portfolios

Best of Luck!
